The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has approved a new order for collection of bulk data on phone calls in the United States, allowing the National Security Agency to continue a practice that has been criticized by some members of Congress and the public. In a statement Friday, the office of the director of national intelligence announced that the court, which operates largely in secret, had permitted the N.S.A. to continue to collect phone logs, which do not include the actual contents of the calls. The original order disclosed last month by Edward J. Snowden, an N.S.A. contractor, expired Friday.
