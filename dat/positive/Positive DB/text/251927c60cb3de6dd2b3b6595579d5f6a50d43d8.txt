New criminal laws prohibit revenge porn, limit license plate readers, change gun rules
House OKs bills on revenge porn, bail bonds training
Raleigh, N.C.  An Apex woman appears to be the first area person charged under North Carolina's new law prohibiting so-called "revenge porn."
Ashley Augustine, 20, of 4320 Suncliffe Court, was charged last month with disclosure of private parts and has been released on a $3,000 bond.
According to an arrest warrant, Augustine posted a photo of a Garner woman having sex "with the intent to harass, demean or humiliate her," knowing that the woman didn't consent to the posting.
The General Assembly last summer passed legislation making such postings a felony and allowing victims to sue perpetrators for damages. The law took effect in December.

"Private parts"? Are we still in 4th grade?Come to think of it, revenge porn is childish.
I'm so glad to see that laws are catching up with the times.
People need to know that the internet isn't entirely a lawless wasteland, despite all appearances.
I really think that this law should be reconsidered. What if I had private pictures and someone stole or found my phone or hacked my Facebook account and posted my personal pictures. How would I be able to defend myself.
How do we know this didn't happen with her? This just isn't right. I totally disagree with this.

Accountability can be tough, but if you can't secure your accounts and phone then you had better be careful what you store there.

You have porn stored on your phone and FB accounts???

Ms. Matthew's that would be my Business if I did or not. For instance you and a friend get into a spiff with each other and she wants to get back at you. She could easily hack your FBook account and post explicit pictures of herself. Then, you would be arrested, charged with a felony and then she is going to sue YOU for this. HOW WOULD YOU PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE? Sounds like a perfect scam for scammers and angry so called friends. I hope you understand what I'm saying here. Thanks, you have yourself a great day
just keep all your porn stuff hidden under your bed like all the teenage boys used to do....

Exactly Mr. Hill, but do all kids listen to their parents these days? Some parents probably don't even check up behind their kids much less talk to them about personal photo's of themselves.. I'm absolutely against this law.. I will be writing a letter to the person who passed this law. It should be reconsidered or changed.. it's just to easy for a scorned person to ruin someone's life..

That's quite a reach - such a convoluted scenario is much less likely than the straightforward revenge postings this law is crafted to punish.
