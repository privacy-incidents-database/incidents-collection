What We Know About Israel's Decision on Western Wall Prayers
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSFEB. 1, 2016, 3:19 P.M. E.S.T.
The decision by Israel's government to allow non-Orthodox Jewish prayer at Jerusalem's Western Wall is being seen as a major breakthrough for the country's long-marginalized liberal believers. Here's what we know about the issue:___— Under the compromise agreement, Israel will build a $9 million plaza for mixed-gender prayer at the Western Wall, adjacent to the Orthodox prayer plaza but separate from it. The Western Wall is a remnant of the ancient Jewish Temple complex and the holiest site where Jews may pray.— Progressives are celebrating Sunday's Cabinet vote as a historic recognition of the Reform and Conservative movements that dominate U.S. Jewish life. American Jews are a key source of support for Israel.— The decision also highlights the deep rift over how religion should be practiced in Israel, where ultra-Orthodox rabbis strictly govern practices such as weddings, divorces and burials. They resist any inroads from liberals often considered to be second-class Jews who ordain women and gays and are overly inclusive toward converts and interfaith marriages.
