LifeLock Agrees to Pay $100 Million Fine in Settlement With F.T.C.
LifeLock, an identity protection service, agreed to a $100 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission for failing to deliver on promises it would guard personal data and inform users when their information was breached.
The F.T.C. said Thursday that the size of the fine, one of the largest from the agency, reflected the egregiousness of LifeLocks actions. The settlement is the companys second with federal enforcement officials. In 2010, the F.T.C. charged the company with failing to provide strong security measures for personal data.
The fact that consumers paid LifeLock for help in protecting their sensitive personal information makes the charges in this case particularly troubling, Edith Ramirez, the F.T.C. chairwoman, said in a statement.
In July, the agency charged LifeLock with failing to put adequate data protections in place for Social Security numbers and for credit card and bank accounts. The agency said that LifeLock falsely claimed in advertisements that it had security systems that were as strong as those used by financial institutions. The company also failed to fulfill a promise that it would inform users when their data was breached, the agency said.
Those actions violated promises made in a 2010 deal with the F.T.C. At that time, the chairman of the agency, Jon Leibowitz, said LifeLocks promises to guard data from identity thieves were woefully inadequate and its protection actually provided enough holes that you could drive a truck through it. LifeLock, based in Tempe, Ariz., agreed then to a $12 million fine.
The majority of the $100 million settlement will be used for redress to consumers harmed by the company, the agency said.
In a statement, the company said, The allegations raised by the F.T.C. are related to advertisements that we no longer run and policies that are no longer in place. The settlement does not require us to change any of our current products or practices.
