Apple Strengthens iCloud Security With 2-Step Authentication
Apple on Thursday rolled out a tool that strengthens password security for Apple accounts: two-step verification, a feature widely available for many Web services.
The security feature, which has to be turned on manually at Apples Web site, lets a user receive a code on another device that can serve as a second password. For example, after entering a password to log in to iTunes or iCloud.com on a computer, the user receives a text message with a temporary four-digit code on his cellphone that must be entered as well to successfully log in.
Apple takes customer privacy very seriously, and two-step verification is an even more robust process to ensure our users data remains protected, said Natalie Kerris, an Apple spokeswoman.
Traditional password systems have been found to be extremely vulnerable to hacks. Security researchers recommend that people use two-step authentication, combined with complex passwords.
Many online services, like Facebook, Google and online banking Web sites, have been offering two-step verification for a while. Apples security came under scrutiny last year after the iCloud account of a technology journalist, Mat Honan, was spectacularly hacked. The blog 9 to 5 Mac first reported the new feature.
