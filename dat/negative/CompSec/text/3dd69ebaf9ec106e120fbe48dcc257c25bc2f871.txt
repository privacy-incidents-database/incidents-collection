To Find the Danger, This Software Poses as the Bad Guys
FOR all our dependence on computer software, the truth is, it isnt very safe. Recent data breaches involving tens of millions of confidential company files have made this all too clear.Why is software potentially so dangerous to the health of a business? There are scores of reasons. The big one is that software systems are so complex that it is next to impossible to find all the holes.That can lead to trouble: hackers stealing trade secrets, for example, or customer information. Company servers can also be infiltrated and used to send spam, or data can inadvertently be exposed to anyone with access to a search engine.The rise of the Web, which encourages companies to connect their programs to those of other companies, creates the potential for even more software problems
most code wasnt written with sharing in mind. Continue reading the main story
Then there is the growing practice of releasing unfinished beta code to the Web to keep ahead of competitors, which can make it seem as if the software industry prefers to fix
products after the fact. Indeed, at times, the software industry appears to be racing downhill while still trying to build its car.
gives companies a way to help keep the wheels on. In February, Veracode introduced SecurityReview, a service that lets companies automatically test their code, either alone or with other businesses. The goal is to find
vulnerabilities that could leave data exposed or that hackers could exploit.Some of these vulnerabilities are as old as software itself  like the buffer overflow, in which hackers hijack computer systems by interrupting
program commands and inserting new ones. Veracodes tool finds these and other common problems with software by acting as an automatic hacker.Little wonder, since the companys founders, Chris Wysopal and Christien Rioux, were members of
the L0pht, a security research group. The L0pht spent much of its time looking for security weaknesses in software, and its members were often criticized as finding problems but not solutions, Mr. Wysopal says. In part to address this, the L0pht evolved into a part of the security consulting firm @Stake (later bought by Symantec).Much of Veracodes software was written by Mr. Rioux, a prolific programmer who says he writes code to relax. (While working on SecurityReview, he wrote a version of the computer game Quake 3: Arena that would run on hand-held computers using Microsofts Windows Mobile operating system  no easy feat, since the chips in such hand-helds dont include the operations typically needed to run high-level computer graphics.)Mr. Riouxs automatic hacking tool grew out of more than a decade of finding software vulnerabilities, and noticing that programmers make the same mistakes over and over again, he says. That led Veracode to develop a patented technique for dealing with these predictable problems. Companies pay for the service by megabytes of code tested, which Veracode says will make it economical for companies to use.Tools like Veracodes are useful because companies would otherwise have to hire security consultants to hack into their systems, a process called penetration testing. This is expensive and limited in its impact  most companies can afford to hire such consultants only for a week or two, and the next time a business
updates its software, it needs another test.The company has already signed its first customers, says Matt Moynahan, Veracodes chief executive. He says theyre attracted to the service partly because it includes a security rating system to assess the risks that software presents to operations.Veracode isnt the first company to try to automate elements of hacking. Companies like Fortify, Coverity and Watchfire offer automated tools to help companies test aspects of their software, as does
Microsoft. But Veracode is the first to offer a service that tests binary code, produced after a programs source code has been put through a compiler and converted into the 0s and 1s needed to make it work.
Joseph Feiman, an analyst at the Gartner Group, the market research firm, says a service to test binary code is a breakthrough because the Web 2.0 phenomenon is built on the idea of companies sharing their applications with partners, suppliers and customers, adding new security risks with every connection.Veracode lets companies test much of that code, though it cannot test scripting tools, particularly important in Web development. It also needs humans to check on false positives and negatives. We cant say were selling a silver bullet, Mr. Wysopal says.Business executives may be forgiven for wondering why theyve spent billions of dollars on firewalls, antivirus software and other security tools, only to find that they need to spend more money.Simeon Simeonov, a venture capitalist whose firm joined with two others to invest $19 million in Veracode, says that what companies
have now is a castle and moat, but those arent going to protect you from the assassin who sneaks in on market day.IT is also important to point out that security develops over time. Federal law did not mandate seat belts in cars until 1968, notes Brian Chess, a former hardware engineer who is now the chief scientist at Fortify, which offers a tool to test source code. He says companies like his are a sign that the software industry is maturing.Michael Howard, a senior security program manager at Microsoft and the author of six books on software security, says he thinks that software cant be compared to traditional engineering. Would a car survive attacks every 15 minutes from anywhere in the world? he asked. I would say no.Microsoft, which as the worlds biggest software company is also the worlds biggest hacker target, stepped up efforts five years ago, when Bill Gates, its chairman and then the chief executive, wrote one of his fabled memos demanding that the company improve the security of its products.Mr. Howard has been intimately involved in that effort, and says that it is paying off. For instance, the latest version of Microsofts Internet Information Server has had one-third of the vulnerabilities discovered in its predecessor.Microsoft has also developed what it calls the Security Development Lifecycle, which mandates how to create a secure software development culture. Microsoft takes security seriously enough to share these even with rivals like Adobe. Even longtime critics of Microsoft say the company has made progress.
Mr. Howard says that more improvements will always be needed
because data thieves will always find new ways to get into systems (some of which, like sweet-talking employees out of passwords, can foil the best software). It is, he says, part of the cost of doing business in the digital age.
