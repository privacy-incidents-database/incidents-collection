Chinese Defense Statement on the U.S. Cyberspying Indictment
The Chinese Ministry of National Defense has issued a statement on its website condemning the United States indictments of five Chinese military officers on charges of hacking into commercial networks to steal corporate secrets. Following is a translation by The New York Times:
On May 19 Beijing time, the United States Department of Justice indicted five members of the Chinese military on charges of so-called commercial cybertheft. China expresses its strong indignation and staunch opposition to this, and already had made solemn representations to the United States.
Chinas stance on Internet security issues has been consistent and clear. China is a protector of Internet security, and the Chinese government and military have never engaged or participated in any theft of commercial secrets over the Internet. The United States claims of so-called commercial cybertheft and so on have been spun out of thin air to bamboozle public opinion, and they have been made out of nefarious motives.
For a long time, the relevant agencies of the United States have relied on its advanced technology and infrastructure to carry out large-scale, organized cybertheft, bugging and monitoring against foreign politicians, businesses and individuals. These facts are known to all. The hypocrisy and double standards of the United States regarding Internet security issues have been abundantly obvious from WikiLeaks to the Snowden affair. The Chinese military is a serious victim of this kind of U.S. conduct. Statistics show that the Internet user terminals of the Chinese military have come under many attacks from abroad in recent years, and IP addresses show that a considerable number of these originated in the United States. China demands that the United States give it a clear explanation of its cybertheft, bugging and monitoring activities, and immediately stop such activity.
Chinese-U.S. military relations have been enjoying healthy development, and this step by the United States flies in the face of its vow to strive to build healthy, stable and reliable military-to-military relations, and it has seriously damaged bilateral mutual confidence. The U.S. side should demonstrate true sincerity and take substantive actions to promote the healthy and stable development of Chinese-U.S. state-to-state and military-to-military relations.
