Morning Agenda: Making a Blind Bet on Uber - The New York Times
Wealthy clients of Morgan Stanley are piling into a special fund that gives them a chance to bet on Uber,
Leslie Picker and Peter Eavis report in DealBook. The fund, New Riders L.P., shows just how much some investors are willing to give up to gain a piece of the hottest start-up.
Investors are effectively handing over their money with their eyes closed. A person briefed on the terms said that institutional investors were getting financial disclosures on revenue and expense metrics and projects, but the offering document for the New Riders fund that The Times reviewed provides no financial details about Uber.
The investors do not get direct equity in Uber either, only indirectly through the fund. This means the fund offers few protections for investors.
But this has not prevented wealthy investors from committing about $500 million to Ubers latest round, which values the company at $62.5 billion, according to people briefed on the transaction.
Morgan Stanley is not the only one offering such funds. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is pitching a similar fund that requires an investment of at least $1 million and a net worth of $100 million, according to people briefed on the terms.
It seems that even as valuations decline and the public stock market stumbles, a sense of euphoria still surrounds this particular unicorn, that is, a private company with a valuation of more than $1 billion.
Martin Shkrelis grilling by Congress was just the spectacle that many were anticipating. Lawyers excoriated him, he smirked and smiled, but refused to answer questions.
Mr. Shkreli repeatedly exercised his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, Andrew Pollack and Emmarie Huetteman report in The New York Times. He is facing federal securities fraud charges.
Members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform were infuriated. I dont think Ive ever seen the committee treated with such contempt, Representative John L. Mica, a Florida Republican, said after Mr. Shkreli left the hearing.
After leaving the room, Mr. Shkreli promptly called the lawmakers imbeciles on Twitter.
There was little substantive discussion about drug price increases. Lawmakers from both parties took turns berating Mr. Shkreli, Turing and Valeant.
Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, complained that Mr. Shkreli didnt have to be prodded to talk when granting television interviews, tweeting or live-streaming his life.
Mr. Shkreli said, I intend to follow the advice of my counsel, not yours.
Two of the worlds biggest toy companies are considering a merger that would bring Hot Wheels and My Little Pony under the same roof,
Bloomberg News reports, citing people familiar with the matter.
Hasbro approached Mattel about a potential transaction late last year, but the details of a potential deal have not been revealed and they have not yet agreed on the merger.
The discussions come as Mattel tries to revive the Barbie brand after losing market share to Lego and My Little Pony in recent years. Mattels revenue is also likely to be hit this year as the licensing rights to Disneys Frozen and Princess brands shift to Hasbro. News of the talks bolstered shares in both companies.
This is not the first time the companies have considered merging. Mattel withdrew a $5.2 billion offer for Hasbro 20 years ago after its competitor used the media and politicians to fight the takeover.
The Labor Department will publish figures on hiring and unemployment in January at 8:30 a.m.
Chinas push to make its own microchips, a move that could bolster its military capabilities and its homegrown technology industry, is attracting attention and suspicion in Washington,
Paul Mozur and Jane Perlez report in The New York Times.
United States officials blocked the proposed purchase of a controlling stake in a unit of the Dutch electronics company Philips by Chinese investors mainly because of worries over Chinas ambitions, according to an expert and a person involved in the deal discussions.
Philips cited concerns raised by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, which reviews whether foreign investments in the country present a national security risk.
The blocking of the deal, worth as much as $2.9 billion, illustrates the
concern in Washington about Chinese efforts to acquire the know-how to make the semiconductors that work as the brains of sophisticated electronics, including military applications like missile systems.
Advancing its chip industry has been a major political initiative for Beijing. Analysts said that in recent years, Chinese corporate espionage and hacking efforts have been aimed at stealing chip technology, while Chinese firms have used government funds to buy foreign companies and technology as well as attract engineers.
Cfius reviews have been a growing problem for outbound Chinese deals. The most recent data available show that in 2012 and 2013, Chinese investment accounted for more committee reviews than money coming from any other country.
Last year, subsidiaries of the state-controlled Tsinghua Holdings made a number of bids for American companies. The flurry of deal activity and a lack of American regulatory response spurred a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst, Mark Newman, to say that the United States runs the risk of being asleep at the wheel.
