The latest in a long line of assaults by conservative activists on the Advanced Placement US history course â€“ which included last Thursdayâ€™s protests at the meeting of the Jefferson County board of education â€“ evolved into a hashtag game this weekend. As Colorado finds itself in the middle of a statewide debate over the teaching of US history, Pam Mazanec, who serves on the state board of education, got involved in an argument on Facebook on 27 September. During a long, drawn-out discussion, she said that in her opinion the curriculum of the Advanced Placement history course â€œdownplay[s] our noble history and accentuate the negative viewâ€. She went on: â€œAs an example, I note our slavery history. Yes, we practiced slavery. But we also ended it voluntarily, at great sacrifice, while the practice continues in many countries still today! Shouldnâ€™t our students be provided that viewpoint? This is part of the argument that America is exceptional.â€ On Twitter, Duke university professor Laurent Dubois, under the name @soccerpolitics, seized on the quote and made it a hashtag: #voluntaryhistory, mocking Mazanecâ€™s assertion and the idea of conservative historical revisionism in general. The game got a signal boost from the Atlanticâ€™s Ta-Nehisi Coates on Sunday. Many of the tweets were funny, but many also cut straight to the bone. At first, focussing on Mazanecâ€™s statement, they centered around slavery and racism. the strength of rope today is a testament to the black rope testers who gave america their necks. #voluntaryhistory (@tanehisicoates) dgls.pl (@dglspl) October 6, 2014 Neighborhood residents greet first Black students of Little Rock Central High School with open arms #voluntaryhistory Monica Roberts (@TransGriot) October 6, 2014 RT @voicetrous: @tanehisicoates Harriet Tubman takes several trips to Canada by foot to promote black fitness. #voluntaryhistory Reese Waters (@reesewaters) October 6, 2014 Some took aim at more modern topics: @tanehisicoates Blacks voluntarily die in order to help improve police officers marksmanship. #voluntaryhistory Down Under (@PopUtsey) October 6, 2014 The U.S. Citizens wanted the government to have all of their personal data without their knowledge. #voluntaryhistory Mike Bates (@mbs_p_b) October 6, 2014 Poor blacks stay in NOLA during Katrina to keep the highways clear for white folks taking their money somewhere dry. #voluntaryhistory Gil Rodman (@GilRodman) October 6, 2014 Loath to burden the sluggish US economy, women decide to accept just 78 cents for each dollar their male colleagues earn. #voluntaryhistory Ess (@ScottyLiterati) October 6, 2014 @tanehisicoates Central Park Five decide to take rap for their friend Matias Reyes. #voluntaryhistory lonelydoll (@lonelydoll) October 6, 2014 Others looked further afield for their historical revisionism: Millions of Vietnamese volunteered to test out the long term effects of Agent Orange so Americans wouldnt need to #voluntaryhistory The angry moderate (@Bucco_Blast) October 6, 2014 Mexican government decides to hand its holdings North of the Rio Grande over to the U.S. for safe-keeping. #voluntaryhistory eponymous (@eponymous) October 6, 2014 Japanese Americans move to desert-themed summer camps to free up Bay area real estate #voluntaryhistory Will Reid (@WReid56) October 6, 2014 #voluntaryhistory George III allows colonies to experiment with autonomy, self-defense.
