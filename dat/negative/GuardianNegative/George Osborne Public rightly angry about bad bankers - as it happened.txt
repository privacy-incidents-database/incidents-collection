  5.38pm GMT    European markets close higher    Despite more weak Chinese data and worries about US rate rises in December, markets have recovered a little poise. A spate of well received earnings reports from Europe, including Carlsberg, helped matters, while the AB InBev bid for SABMiller also lifted investors’ spirits. The final scores showed:  The FTSE 100 finished up 21.92 points or 0.35% at 6297.20 Germany’s Dax added 0.7% to 10.907.87 France’s Cac closed 0.82% higher at 4952.51 Spain’s Ibex ended 0.39% better at 10,377.2 An exception was Italy’s FTSE MIB which dipped 0.26% to 22,385.11  On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 37 points or 0.2%. On that note, it’s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we’ll be back tomorrow.       5.25pm GMT         You heard him! Drinks on Mark #BoEOpenForum Fergal OBrien (@fergalob) November 11, 2015         5.24pm GMT       And then Carney is gone, after a promise of drinks in the crypt for those in the Guildhall, drinks on the Daily Mail’s Alex Brummer for those who attended his session in Edinburgh and for those at home, drinks in the local pub on the Bank thanks to its QE programme.       5.20pm GMT       Carney: [It is] the responsibility of authorities to explain why things are being done. Lot of postings said there is a lot of jargon...even as we are trying to explain things.    Updated at 5.21pm GMT     5.16pm GMT       In his closing remarks, Bank of England governor Mark Carney - who maintained his net contribution was to come up with the words Open Forum - repeated the disconnect between the sector and the public: We are all going to go back and reflect on what we’ve learned. [In the sessions there was] almost universal reaffirmation of the imporatance of markets,... not just to the econmy but to people’s everyday lives. But the level of trust is quite low. Disconnect in how we in finance see sector and how public see the sector. The disconnect is not in public’s mind. There is optimism around institutions, a lot has been done to make banks stronger, they are beginning to adjust their business models. [We can say to them] there is no other big wave of capital regulation coming, last pieces of puzzle are put in place. Now it’s about adjusting business models to new realities. Business models pre-crisis not going to be effective now. Back to trust and he said: Trust is low for two reasons, because of misconduct. lack of client focus.       5.03pm GMT       As we edge towards the close, both the Bank’s Jon Cunliffe and chair of this final panel Sir Richard Lambert agree the discussion has been useful and should continue after this event finishes.

Quite so. #BoEOpenForum josh ryan-collins (@jryancollins) November 11, 2015         4.40pm GMT       A rival candidate for quote of the day, from the final panel going on now. Talking about debt and credit, the Reverend Canon Giles Fraser said:  We are approaching this terrible time called Christmas.. go into the Westfield shopping centre and you’ll see tens of thousands of people buying lots of things they don’t want with money they don’t have for people they don’t like. We’re encouraged to do this because of this thing called growth. I worry about moral hazard of debt...

The financial industry needs to understand the public. Gillian Guy at  #BoEOpenForum Mette Reitzel (@MetteMorph) November 11, 2015      Updated at 4.29pm GMT     4.23pm GMT       Adding to the theme of banking and its wider role in society as heard at the Bank of England’s open forum, Mark Taylor, Dean of Warwick Business School and a former senior economist at the Bank, said:  Mark Carney is on a charm offensive in order to encourage the public to think about bankers in a better way. After all we need a strong financial sector, it represents eight per cent of the UK’s GDP and 20 per cent of income in London alone. It is an important part of the economy, and in order to grow other sectors like manufacturing we need a strong financial sector. But the banking sector needs to act ethically and in the best interests of society for it to work properly. We need bankers to think of their impact on society and not just on their wallet.        4.03pm GMT       European Central Bank president Mario Draghi may not have caused any market moving sparks in his speech at the Open Forum earlier. But Reuters is reporting that the ECB is considering extending its QE programme by buying municipal bonds of cities like Paris or regions like Bavaria, according to sources. Reuters says:  This regional bond buying could be one in a series of measures to be rolled out in the coming months, although one of the sources said time was short for a full launch in December and that this would likely come by March next year. The ECB declined to comment. Despite the ECB’s scheme of quantitative easing (QE) to buy chiefly state bonds, the eurozone’s economy is growing only modestly and the central bank is urgently considering what more it can do to improve it and stagnant price inflation. As part of preparations for the next rate-setting meeting of policy-setters on Dec. 3, ECB officials are now analysing whether and how to extend its shopping list to municipal bonds, issued by, say, Madrid or Mainz, or a federal German state. “You have big markets, such as Spain and Italy. France has a well developed market,” said one person. According to data from Thomson Reuters IFR, almost $500 billion of bonds issued by European cities and regions are in circulation. The regions have sold more than $76 billion of bonds over the last year. The source said that while some cities were risky, they had the fallback of central governments. Municipal bonds typically have a lower credit rating than governments. It is a fragmented market in Europe, with many small issues.        3.51pm GMT       Back with the Bank of England’s Open Forum, and here’s something to illustrate the main themes, ahead of the day’s summing up.

It repeated its estimate of 3.1% growth in 2015 and 2.7% in 2016. But it admits the risks to these forecasts have increased since June.       3.41pm GMT       Meanwhile in Greece, the country’s banks will need less than €10bn for recapitalisation, MNI is reporting.       3.13pm GMT       There’s not much to argue with here....and maybe that’s the problem:    Participants in the Edinburgh #BoEOpenForum are reporting back on the themes of their round-table discussions pic.twitter.com/rusB3xCnIk BoENorthEast (@BoENorthEast) November 11, 2015      Increasing financial education, transparency, trust and responsibility are big themes of the groups findings so far #BoEOpenForum BoENorthEast (@BoENorthEast) November 11, 2015         3.11pm GMT       Some analysis of Draghi’s speech:    This speech is definitely a thinly veiled attack on Camerons vision of a capital market union supervised by natl institutions #BoEOpenForum Jonathan Algar (@jonathanalgar) November 11, 2015      Just read this whilst listening at #BoEOpenForum - Draghi makes the case for the EU if you want a single market  https://t.co/M3yg2DezwV Anne Fairweather (@AnneFairweather) November 11, 2015         3.03pm GMT         Superb comments by @MazzucatoM on how rent-seeking and VC short-termism undermine value-creating financial innovation at #BoEOpenForum John Fingleton (@JohnFingleton1) November 11, 2015         3.00pm GMT       Professor Mariana Mazzucato has been busy debunking hype in the world of financial innovation. She told a panel at the Open Forum that many new wizzy ideas have actually helped companies to extract wealth, and give very little back society:    Financial innovation has increased outsized free riding/rent extraction effect in GDP not reduced it, says @MazzucatoM  (my hero) Izabella Kaminska (@izakaminska) November 11, 2015      We need the right sort of innovation, not rent seeking innovation, says @MazzucatoM #boeopenforum Izabella Kaminska (@izakaminska) November 11, 2015         2.53pm GMT       Has the Bank of England done any war gaming and worked out under what conditions it would intervene in the markets? Couldn’t possibly say, Minouche laughs. But generally, Bank officials have done a lot of work on this general issue to prepare for a liquidity crisis.       2.40pm GMT       Axel Weber, chairman of UBS, warns there is a ‘vacuum’ in the markets now as some institutions - such as UBS - no longer act as market makers.  He cites the impact of new tougher regulations, which make it too risky and costly. And that could be a risk, when the next crisis strikes and everyone wants liquidity....       2.37pm GMT    BoE's Shafik: Very real risks in emergency liquidity operations    Flicking between this afternoon’s discussions at the Open Forum, there’s a lot of talk about market liquidity. Asset managers are explaining that liquidity could easily evaporate once the next crisis strikes, as many investors have already cut their exposure to riskier assets. And deputy governor Minouche Shafik is also discussing it, saying:  Liquidity is a public good, and central bankers have a duty to guarantee it.  And the last crisis showed that central banks can widen their remit and pump money into non-banks (such as insurance group AIG in America).     Minouche Shafik today Photograph: Bank of England    But there are “very real risks”, Shafik continues, in acting like a market-maker of last resort, and buying assets when everyone wants to sell. 1) The moral hazard issue: banks won’t worry about maintaining their own liquidity levels if they think the BoE will save them.  2) Financial risks: liquidity operations are much riskier than simply buying assets, And its harder to tell if an entity is solvent. 3) Political risks: there are ‘distributions’ consequences (ie: wealth distribution -- bank assets are owned by the rich, but bailouts are paid by everyone) So, it should only be a ‘last line of defence’, Shafki concludes.

Well, back in June, he and four other eurozone presidents called for an EU-wide deposit insurance by 2017. That would sit on top of existing national deposit schemes, providing extra protection. Currently, each eurozone nation guarantees €100,000 of savings if a bank goes under. Those guarantees, though, are only as strong as the country in question.       1.47pm GMT       This is a bit harsh:    #Draghi nods off during his own speech pic.twitter.com/sy5VG9KsS3 ForexLive (@ForexLive) November 11, 2015    OK, it wasn’t the speech you’ll tell your grandchildren about - but this is serious, nitty-gritty stuff, with major ramifications if regulators make another hash of things. The whole speech is online here.       1.45pm GMT       And that’s it! Draghi isn’t taking any questions, much to my dismay. And the speech didn’t contain anything to get the markets moving - no hints about future stimulus measures.    whaT. zero zip nada hint from #Draghi regarding expand/extend QE or possible cut in deposit rate @CNBC Louisa Bojesen (@louisabojesen) November 11, 2015      Latest bit of commentary from Draghi  co is a bit...boring. Nothing too revealing or interesting yet re: December policy action. $EURUSD Christopher Vecchio (@CVecchioFX) November 11, 2015         1.43pm GMT       The eurozone does already have some banking union, with the ECB responsible for banking supervisions. But it doesn’t yet have a uniform deposit insurance scheme. This is still controlled by national governments. Mario Draghi’s message is that politicians need to pool more sovereignty, to ensure their financial markets work better:    Draghi: In Europe national policymakers cannot fully protect citizens without pooling more sovereignty #BoEOpenForum ECB (@ecb) November 11, 2015      Draghi: ECB banking supervision benefits citizens, member countries and the single market #BoEOpenForum ECB (@ecb) November 11, 2015      Updated at 1.43pm GMT     1.38pm GMT    Draghi: Eurozone needs proper banking union, ASAP    OK we’ve got to the meat of the speech. Mario Draghi is urging eurozone leaders to crack on and actually implement a full banking union across the eurozone, including a single deposit insurance scheme to protect savers when their bank fails. The ECB president says:  With a single currency the benefits of a single market are commensurately higher. But the costs of the market fragmenting are commensurately higher, too. For countries that share a single currency and a single market, therefore, the case is clear – I would say almost undeniable – for stronger common governance and deeper institutional integration.  Today, that means as a priority completing banking union: a fully-equipped single resolution mechanism and a uniform deposit insurance scheme.  That would mean that money was equally seen as safe wherever it was saved in the eurozone, to stop panic spreading . This is a controversial issue in the eurozone -- German taxpayers may be worried about potentially compensating Greek savers. But Draghi is clear - it’s simply too risky to not have such guarantees in place when the next crisis arrives.    Draghi: To reap benefits of open and free markets appropriate governance is necessary #BoEOpenForum ECB (@ecb) November 11, 2015    Draghi’s conclusion --all markets need proper governance to be truly free, especially in a single currency union:  Those countries have entered into an irrevocable union, built on the fertile ground of Europe’s common values and history, but also on deep mutual vulnerability. For those countries it is even more important to complete economic and monetary union in all its aspects.     Updated at 2.00pm GMT     1.32pm GMT       Draghi adds that attempts to clean up the asset-backed securities market after the 2008 crash also caused problems: There was “too much opacity” about what had been bundled into those products, a damaging breakdown of confidence in the integrity of those who packaged and sold them.   And the immediate temptation of regulators was to impose punishing capital charges on holdings of asset-backed securities, independent of their individual characteristics, mixing the wheat with the chaff.        1.28pm GMT       A proper market must offer the freedom to take part, and also protection to ensure that freedom isn’t lost, Draghi continues. There must be fair competition, respect for property rights... in short, the Rule of Law. If that doesn’t happen, then people lose confidence and the whole system becomes destabilised. Fair enough! But we’ve seen an example recently when this simply failed, causing major panic. Draghi explains:  During the crisis, the market for securitised assets was all but destroyed by a collapse of confidence. Lack of oversight allowed excesses to be committed and market abuse to take place. Securities that were previously deemed safe, certainly with some measure of complacency and too much blind confidence, turned out to be very unsafe indeed, and imparted significant losses on their holders.     Updated at 1.29pm GMT     1.24pm GMT       Global trade is more important and intertwined than ever, Draghi says, with technology means distance between buyers and sellers is no longer as important. Global markets are also more closely linked, with the cost of moving capital between borders now almost zero.       1.22pm GMT       Draghi begins by saying that markets can be defined by the instruments traded on them - oil, gold, etc - but they’re also defined by the people who use them. And you need appropriate governance to prevent misconduct - especially when markets cross borders.       1.20pm GMT    Mario Draghi speaks in London    Lunch is over at the Guildhall, and Mario Draghi is taking the stage at the Bank of England’s Open Forum. He’ll be speaking for 45 minutes on the financial markets. Andy Haldane, the Bank’s chief economist, is introducing him. He reminds us that Draghi pledged 3 years ago in London to do “whatever it takes” to protect the euro. Those ‘magic three little words’ helped to calm the eurozone crisis, and put the global economy on a more even keel.  We all have a lot to be thankful for to Mario, Haldane says. You can watch the session here.        Updated at 1.50pm GMT     1.15pm GMT       In other news, the car emissions scandal appears to be spreading beyond Volkswagen.

I dont think its that funny.... Fran Boait (@franboait) November 11, 2015    Osborne was clear this morning that despite the crisis of 2008 and its aftermath, Britain is still aiming to be a world-leader in finance, based around the City.  The aim is to make the market function fairly, and much better than before, but that hasn’t been tested yet.... Fran Boait is executive director of Positive Money, which is “a movement to democratise money and banking so that it works for society and not against it”.    Updated at 11.39am GMT     11.14am GMT       The thorny issue of the huge pay packets handed out in the City has finally reared up at the Guildhall. The public believe it is a crucial cause of the crisis - so will it be fixed? David Kynaston, visiting professor at Kingston University, argues that City remuneration must be tackled. He tells the Open Forum that:  If the City and the financial markers are serious about achieving a genuine social licence, real action needs to be taken on pay because it remains a grotesque disparity.  Rabbi Baroness Julia Neuberger agrees, warning that badly-structured packets create an incentive to trade that isn’t in the interests of the market, but is in the interest of the individual. [This argument is often made by supports of a Tobin Tax, or Robin Hood tax] Helena Morrissey, CEO of Newton Investment Management, argues that there needs to be more “symmetry” among pay -- if traders get a chunk upside for doing well, there should be more downside when it goes wrong. [new rules allowing bonuses to be clawed back years after they were granted go some way to addressing this] And Jim O’Neill points out that Goldman Sachs was a partnership for some of the time he worked there - so individual’s capital was on the line. (that ended when Goldman floated in 1999). That could be a better model for some parts of the City, but probably not for client-facing roles, he concludes.    Updated at 11.15am GMT     10.59am GMT       Jim O’Neill has warned the audience that there will be new financial crisis sooner or later. But if we have more diverse companies operating in the sector, the damage might be less.    A financial crisis will happen again says Lord Jim ONeill at #BoEOpenForum More diversity needed, the Treasury minister says Jill Treanor (@jilltreanor) November 11, 2015         10.56am GMT         There is a bit of a theme developing, about conflict between desire for safety and need for risk-taking to support growth #BoEOpenForum Frances Coppola (@Frances_Coppola) November 11, 2015         10.51am GMT       This is crying out for a caption competition.....

Jill Treanor (@jilltreanor) November 11, 2015         10.49am GMT       There’s not much confidence in Birmingham that the financial markets are fixed. The Bank of England has set up a smaller forum in Britain’s second city, to shadow events in London. Attendees were asked “do you think Financial Markets had a key role creating the financial crisis and the recession that we experienced in the UK?”. Virtually everyone raised their hands:      And second, “are you now confident that financial markets are operating in an ethical way that would prevent such a crisis and a recession hitting us again?” Cue much sitting on hands.....           10.39am GMT       Treasury minister Jim O’Neill, a former top executive at Goldman Sachs, cautions against thinking that the financial crisis can be easily ‘solved’   It’s right that we’re trying to explore why the hell it was so bad...but we have to also acknowledge that we might not fully know. It’s dangerous to think we’ll find some magical solution to protect us for decades ahead.        10.36am GMT       A panel discussions is now underway now in the Guildhall. Rabbi Baroness Neuberger is taking a historical view, saying bankers have been criticised for several generations - and they’re always relieved when another industry is hit by scandal (such as Volkswagen’s emissions scandal or the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico).    Julia Neuberger tells #BoEOpenForum that bankers were relieved by the VW and BP oil spill disaster Jill Treanor (@jilltreanor) November 11, 2015    Baroness Neuberger also argues that a banking code of conduct won’t push up standards on its own.  It takes outsiders to show when something is being done wrong, even if professionals are following the code.    Updated at 11.24am GMT     10.31am GMT       While Osborne was speaking, new data showed that Britain’s unemployment rate has hit a new seven-year low of just 5.3%. But it’s not all good news - wage growth was weaker than expected. Average earnings rose by 3% annually in the last quarter, but only 2% in September alone.    Touching distance. UK unemployment falls to 5.3%, a whisker away from 2000-07 average of 5.1%. pic.twitter.com/goiGmZrXW2 RBS Economics (@RBS_Economics) November 11, 2015      #Employment rate 73.7% for Jul-Sep 2015, highest since records began in 1971 https://t.co/Cx4CoquCVb pic.twitter.com/pW6dHUMoYK ONS (@ONS) November 11, 2015      For Jul-Sep 2015 wages up 3.0% on a year earlier including bonuses,  2.5% excluding bonuses https://t.co/ujz2apLFKh pic.twitter.com/C8pmI6prQ6 ONS (@ONS) November 11, 2015         10.11am GMT          George Osborne at the Bank of England’s Open Forum today Photograph: Bank of England         10.06am GMT    Osborne: Public are right to be angry over banking crash    Does George Osborne understand why the public are still so angry about the crisis, and believe that the people responsible never paid a penalty?  He says he does, telling the Bank of England’s Open Forum that it’s perfectly understandable.... and he shares some of this frustration and anger. We were told that the City was well regulated, and people were paid high salaries because they ran big risks and would lose their jobs if things went wrong. Then along comes a big banking crash, and it turns out that the person standing behind the bank is the taxpayer.   If you go and shoplift at the local WH Smiths you go to prison, but if you’re the market trader on the trading floor of a big investment bank and you rip off people to the tune of millions of pounds, there are no criminal offences available to deal with you. There was a lot of totally understandable anger.  The chancellor also says it’s “a bit optimistic” for bankers to ask him when we can move on from the crisis.  This was the biggest single economic crash of our lifetimes.  This was a financial crisis probably larger than anything experienced since the Victorian age in our country, and an economic crash and a recession as great as anything since the 1930s.  The industry, regulators and politicians must prove that the banking sector has cleaned up its game. And that’s the end of his session.    Updated at 10.27am GMT     9.52am GMT       A questioner from the floor challenges Osborne on that last point. She points out that big fines are paid by shareholders, not the staff responsible. And the 2008 bailouts were paid by the taxpayer, not the bankers who led their firms to the cliffedge. Surely we need more accountability? Osborne says the government has created new criminal offences to cover benchmark manipulation. And individual bankers who cause their banks to fail would face seven years in prison.  When I got into office [after the 2010 general election] and found out about the scandal, I changed the law.     Updated at 10.08am GMT     9.49am GMT       Onto questions: Would a bankers code of conduct help to restore financial trust? Osborne says that Banking, like the medical profession, engineering, architecture, has a proud history. The best practitioners want to enhance that status, and regulated by the industry itself as well as the government. The Banking Standards Board is doing good work getting codes of conduct up to date, improving exams, to reflect the ethical standards need. But he then argues that monetary penalties should keep bankers in line.  If anyone thinks being unethical in the financial services industry is a good way to make money, I’d suggest they take a look at the very, very large fines that a number of institutions have had to pay.....and ask whether it was worth it.  Management and shareholders must take the lead, to ensure that staff don’t make an extra buck on the trading floor that leads to a massive penalty for the firm, Osborne concludes.       9.42am GMT       George Osborne also congratulated the Bank for running a webinar for school children this week, and admitted it was a new term to him.
