Google Big Tent: Ed Miliband, Eric Schmidt and more
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/22/google-big-tent-ed-miliband-eric-schmidt-and-more
  3.46pm BST    And that's it: Miliband and Schmidt left at loggerheads    A recap of the day: Ed Miliband suggested that Google should practise responsible capitalism and chided the company for not living by the tenets of its founders letter to shareholders in 2004; Eric Schmidt rejected the suggestion that theres anything more than the letter of the law for deciding how to organise tax affairs. The tax row goes on - with no clear sign of a solution on either side, so far. Thanks for being with us today.       3.25pm BST    Government data continued ...    Heather Brooke describing mutant data – particularly health: Huge number of datasets collected about health. “Third risk – information asymmetry: information is power, and power is unaccountable when its faceless where theres no individual you can talk to. Watch lists, kill lists, war logs. WikiLeaks war logs discovered Task Force 373, which has no due process, but went around killing people [in Afghanistan/Iraq]. Particularly with the state having the monopoly of force, when data is collected and you dont know – thats where the principles of consent and accountability is needed. A lot of people dont want knowledge out there, but for the public good the datasets need to be out there. But companies are like this – Facebook has an office in London, but they wont tell you where it is because they want to keep it behind this wall (fabulous irony). Theres no contradiction between freedom of information and privacy.    Updated at 3.33pm BST     3.20pm BST    Heather Brooke: the risks of government collection and data dissemination    The famous Professor Brooke (of MPs’ expenses fame; shes a professor at City University)... We have little choice about having a government, we have to fund it whether we like it or not, and it has a monopoly on force ... which can be contracted out ... We have an official identity that can be usurped by the state.” Brooke tells the story of the American who didnt exist because he didnt have a credit record and wasnt on the council file, because theyd made a clerical error changing an ‘S’ to a ‘G’. Your official identity becomes more important than your actual one.    Updated at 3.24pm BST     3.17pm BST    How data can help keep communities safe    Emmanuel Kala of Ushahidi (which if I recall is a project in which Clay Shirky had a hand, at least as a midwife). Ushahidi is used to co-ordinate information after disasters ... or to monitor elections and hate speech, as it was in Kenya. (… somewhat hard to figure out what is being discussed here. Ill give you a few of the words..) crowdsourcing ... poilicies that create a permissive environment.. Ushahidi can collect data from social media too.    Updated at 3.20pm BST     3.10pm BST    We're now doing some 7-minute talks... First: Cancer Resaerch    First one from Amy Carton of Cancer Research on programs for crowdsourcing cancer cures....(its a bit hard to transcribe the video shes on...) Shes telling us about genegame – where people can analyse genes on smartphones. There are 12 that you can play and take part in.    Updated at 3.18pm BST     3.01pm BST    Schmidt:    A barrister asks on tax: You said youll comply with the laws, will you comply with the spirit as well, because theyre very different things. Schmidt: Youll have to explain the distinction. I take a relatively straightforward view. Barrister: If somebody comes into to say Ill restructure to let you keep 82% of your earnings ... that means Im keeping with the letter of the law, but the spirit says as a barrister I should be in that high bracket paying above 40% to 50%, and Im keeping HMRC away from my money. If given that chance to restructure to abide by the letter but not spirit ... which choice? Schmidt: Were governed by US securities law.. in that scenario it might be seen as incompetence, and you could classify some of it as a donation ... that exhausts my understanding of international tax law. But internationally were governed by many legal jurisdictions, not just the UKs. Krishnan Guru-Murthy: Capitalism – it means different things in different places? Its absolutely worshipped in the US but not in the UK? Schmidt: Google is a capitalist country ... company. (In front of the TV cameras, oh my.) Its easy to say you would like us have less profits and have that somewhere else – we will comply with the letter of the law but were trying to avoid being doubly and triply taxed which would prevent us investing in some of the wilder things.    Updated at 3.18pm BST     2.56pm BST       Stella Creasy MP: How would you reform our tax system? Schmidt: Personal answer: when you have high differential tax rates you will have widely divergent outcomes, you have this in the US where you have lots of different rates. Theres some feeling this is good because it makes governments moderate ... this is a big fight in the economics community. Have a rational system thats predictable and doesnt change very much. I dont think taxes should be the same everywhere – theyre a cultural construct.    Updated at 3.16pm BST     2.55pm BST       Q: How soon before Google Now passes the Turing test? Schmidt chuckles. (The Turing test is when you cant tell if its human or a computer; Google Now is its AI system for telling you where to go.) He waffles a bit, talks about IBMs Watson (which won Jeopardy) and suggests that could do it in five to 10 years. Google Now? Mine is confused because Im on a book tour.    Updated at 3.16pm BST     2.54pm BST       Philip Blond (the Tory spinthinker?): A digital ombudsman: whats your advice about how to approach dominance in the internet age? Schmidt: Im not familiar with UK laws but am with EU laws ... If you look at the dominant companies of the PC industry theyre not the ones in the internet age. Its pretty easy to lose dominance in the internet age as consumers shift, this is the one click away problem, in Googles case – 900m Android users, were happy with that, we achieved that by giving away the source code and letting you change it as you wish. I would argue that ... should the government appoint an ombudsman? I think the internet is pretty competitive.    Updated at 3.15pm BST     2.51pm BST       ITV News asks: The deputy prime minister said on Monday you should pay your fair share – what will it take to change your tax arrangements? Schmidt: Depending on how the law changes. Or the governments in other countries ... of course!    Updated at 3.14pm BST     2.50pm BST    Questions for Schmidt    Big Brother Watch asks: Youve had legal proceedings in the US and Europe about how you use data, which is how you raise Google; a poll showed that 66% of adults in the UK wanted data regulated to protect privacy online ... (Schmidt has his concerned face on.) Schmidt: This may be a case where we disagree with the interpretation ... we try to be as transparent as we can about what were doing with peoples data ... we would say this is what were doing with your data ... This was widely covered. From our perspective we disclosed what we were doing. So there must be another interpretation. There must be concern were going to misuse this data and not tell you. There seems to be a separate concern that we use the data at all, but thats how we pay for the servers we use and so on. But if we were to violate your privacy we would lose your trust and wouldnt get you back. We have a clear business incentive to protect your privacy because if we dont we will lose you. We say it, we do it, we suffer a penalty if we dont do it, and well get sued, because we get sued on everything. I think this conversation is a metaphor – people are concerned about the data thats collected from them.    Updated at 3.13pm BST     2.46pm BST    Work, life, and everything    On to the future of work and life. Schmidt: Theres a whole meme of people wandering around saying there will be no jobs but there are winners and losers - the winners will be the educated ones. Jared Cohen: even when people havent got access to the internet, they recognise it as a place for access and free expression – its raising consciousness. Take Estonia, 1.3m people with a cold war legacy. Estonias economy is small, its not a world powerhouse, but in cyberspace citizens can pay and vote online, working with the FInns to provide an interoperable system, they provide services to other countries – its a cyber-superpower. In a world thats more connected will they have the chance to punch around their weight if they make the right decisions about transparency and accountability.    Updated at 3.12pm BST     2.40pm BST    ...and here they are         Eric Schmidt    Updated at 3.11pm BST     2.35pm BST    Schmidt on tax    Q: But you effectively pay a licence for using Google to Google Ireland. Theres a huge amount of money leaving European tax jurisdictions and going to Bermuda and no tax paid on it. Schmidt: The no tax part is not true. We love the UK, its a huge operation for us, we have 3,000 employees, doing a huge development in Kings Cross, we care a lot about this, Google is free to the citizens of the UK as to the rest of the world, we work very have not only to follow the rules but to make the world a better place. Q: But I get a tax bill, dont get to choose where I pay tax ... Schmidt: Indeed we do ... Q: But the same way ... Schmidt: I cant defend the international rtax regime, both your government and mine say it needs to be changed, I cant defend an irrational structure, a computer engineer would not have designed this. Q: Ed Miliband says he will change it ... Schmidt: If he does, if he does so, we will follow the rules. Q: If Britain acted unilaterally, would that affect your decisions? Schmidt: Hopefully the law wouldnt say Google, the debate over whether you tax companies ... I have some personal feelings, Google will continue to invest in the UK no matter what you guys do, we love you guys too much., we will continue investing in the UK no matter what. And so the tax questions end, for now.    Updated at 3.10pm BST     2.31pm BST       Schmidt: Taxes are not a choice. Q (from Krishnan Guru-Murthy): The way you use transfer pricing, Ed Miliband says thats wrong. Youve taken a decision to put a lot of money in Bermuda, and you take moral positions in lots of other areas. Schmidt: If the international tax regime changes we will too. Q: But is that moral? Schmidt:Virtually all the American companies have tax structures like this, and UK companies operating in the US do too. But if we pay more taxes in one area then we pay less in another. Q to critics it feels like Google is outmaneouvring the governments. Schmidt:Governments have a lot more power than we do. They do. If the law changes, we will follow it ... we dont negotiate taxes, they are the law. Q: But what about how much money you send to Bermuda? Schmidt: I dont personally know, but we absolutely disclose it.    Updated at 3.06pm BST     2.28pm BST    Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen on stage    Krishnan Guru-Murthy of Channel 4 News is asking the questions. Q: Eric Schmidt has just arrived. Lets just deal with the tax question first. Ed Miliband was terrible disapoointed you werent here ... is your tax structure wrong? Schmidt: No. Google feels very very strongly that tax information, tax policy should be done openly. I dont think companies should decide tax policy, governments should ... were in a very long-standing tax regime ... we need to have a conversation about this, were not trying to do the wrong thing, were trying to do the right thing. We dont want to be in a situation where we get double or quadruple taxed ...    Updated at 3.07pm BST     2.20pm BST    ... and we're back! Eric Schmidt will be with us imminently ...    The executive chairman of Google is going to talk about tax. Pity he wasnt here earlier, when he could have heard Ed Miliband being quite blunt that Google is being short-term in its tax affairs – and using its S-1 filing as the stone to hit it with. One point made by an attendee: how odd that Schmidt was absent this morning, because he was here for the previous two days (when Google held its Zeitgeist days, which arent open to the press). A convenient absence? Or a clash of calendars? He seems to have these regrettable misses – last year he missed the panel about child safety, and the year before about privacy.     Updated at 3.03pm BST     1.13pm BST    We'll be back in a while...    Well now be taking a break – lunch beckons.    Updated at 3.02pm BST     1.13pm BST       Q: Warfare and competition ... the original moonshot ... Does Google X want to get there before the other guys, or do you want to just get there? Teller: I want to get there as fast as possible. The more do it, the sooner we will. I dont care if Google does it or someone else does. The single thing thats most effective isnt saying theyll get rich, or pit groups against each other. We made this steampunk trophy and every quarter each one of the moonshot groups sets an audacious milestone, incredibly high, and they tell the other groups, and its for the pride – looking good relative to the other groups. They work incredibly hard for the small chance of hitting the target and getting this rocket-ship trophy with no monetary value. Everybody feels theyre in it together. Instead of sandbagging it so its easy, we have many quarters where they dont.    Updated at 3.02pm BST     1.09pm BST       Shovelling money at problems hasnt been the best way to get things resolved. (OK, my battery needs a moonshot now....) If I could cheer on government, it would be to take personal responsibility to enable more moonshots – not directly taking them.    Updated at 3.01pm BST     1.07pm BST       You probably dont have Montessori schools in the UK. A shivery rumble goes through the somewhat middle-class room. Oh, you do.    Updated at 3.01pm BST     1.05pm BST       Google X ... Sebastian Thrun started it, but now isnt there at Google, because hes looking to fix education. If I had to put a bet on where the next radical fix for education will come from, Id put it on Udacity [which Thrun founded].    Updated at 3.00pm BST     1.01pm BST       Q: What are the low-hanging fruits of moonshots? A: Global warming ... agriculture ... health care especially in the US, ageing population, and we dont even get great results. Transportation is a good one, self-driving cars would be awesome but thats not the alpha and omega – we spend a lot of money moving things around, theres lots of room to move around. The construction industry creates about $6tr of waste and 20% of greenhouse gases, and we cant house everyone whos going to be born in the next 20 years. The manufacturing industry is seriously overdue for an update... the QWERTY keyboard was designed 100 years ago to make you type slower ... thats a good start.     Updated at 3.00pm BST     12.58pm BST       I could rant like this for hours... lets do some questions. (Yes, lets.) Jon Snow comes over: Cern ... completely funded by governments. remarkable.. Teller (is he related to the atomic physicist or the magician?): Id gently ask the question... the first thing was that its going to solve a huge problem in the world.. Id love for someone to come and explain what problem they are solving. (My riposte: how to organise a really big physics system)    Updated at 2.59pm BST     12.54pm BST    Moonshots, and how to do them    Astro Teller talks about what governments could do: what about setting long-term capital gains tax ... forcing people to put it in holding for five years ... revenue ... corporations ... ah, hes trying to find a way to get tax into it. Its the topic du jour. There have been examples in the past where governments have taken the best moonshots in history. Bletchley Park. The Manhattan Project. The Great Wall of China. The aqueducts that brought water into Rome. But all of these were military in nature. The exigency was great. You want this, but to give people the permission to be as weird as necessary to make the world radically better. When war is the matter, things get twisted. Apollo 11 was great for the world.. but why do we have to wait for a war? Why do we do 10%, why not go for 10x [times]?    Updated at 2.59pm BST     12.50pm BST       He offers people the choice between a safe investment or a risky huge payoff one. Lots of people choose the huge payoff. Youre all moonshot thinkers! Well, easy enough in this context. If you get hundreds of shots, which big companies do, theres no reason not to. Err ... do big companies get lots of chances to build quantum computers and self-driving cars? Not so sure there. Corporations have the least excuse, because they dont have motivations like the public good.  (Yes, but the original moonshot was done by a government and had nothing to do with the public good. It was an arms race thing.)    Updated at 2.58pm BST     12.47pm BST       The self-driving car is the poster child of moonshots. The big question: how can governments take moonshots? (One would think thats where the original name came from, isnt it?) (Here he is on Instagram.) Everybody thinks its somebody elses job. Its not about how much money you have, or smart people, its about bravery and creativity. Vision that something can be solved... that gives you reason to believe, not just blind faith.       12.40pm BST    Jon Snow and Google's captain of moonshots    Roll video! (And pray for my battery life, which is dying fast.) And his name really is ASTRO TELLER.       12.37pm BST       (Questions on this are much more lively than for Miliband.) Q: This is all about personal data ... Tesco, Google, Amazon.. but nobody is discussing that fundamental data is being used to try to help me understand what datas out there ... were not equipping people to understand whats going on. (Hmm, easy to forget that Tescos data crunching makes Googles look tame, at least in terms of shopping. Tesco knows much more about your home life than Google, probably.) Theres no simple answer ... and were done.    Updated at 2.56pm BST     12.33pm BST    Allotments and technology and WFH    Q: Are we too fixated about technology? Dont we need to teach kids cognitive skills rather than the technology itself? (Applause for questioner Dave Coplin from Microsoft) Matt Atkinson of Tesco totally agrees. Q from a social business consultancy: People feel like robots in work ... how does the blend of humanity and technology improve life at work? A: Julie Dean of the Cambrige Satchel Co: Were introducing allotments...? (You have to imagine the enormously hopeful tone.) They let people work from home on Fridays if they want. Its not about just giving money bonuses - thats like gift vouchers on birthdays, isnt really the right way. (For a technology meetup, its getting very touchy-feely.)    Updated at 3.05pm BST     12.24pm BST    Robots! In supermarkets!    ....And were back, with a panel on robots, which somehow (because we have someone from Tesco) is turning into the question of whether wed ever have robots in Tesco. Some would say we already do, says Matt Atkinson of Tesco. Pause. Krishnan Guru-Murthy: thats almost a Ratner remark.       11.34am BST    Miliband finishes...    Jon Snow takes over to ask a question following up on Nick Robinson question: do you regard the big internet companies as the banks of the past? Miliband: The banks caused a financial meltdown well be paying for, Google isnt about to do that, but I do have deep problems with the culture because it is short-term, because that letter [S-1] said even if its in short-term interest we shouldnt necessarily do it if it isnt in long-term interest. And with that, hes done.    Updated at 3.05pm BST     11.32am BST       Apple/Amazon/Google all benefited from venture capital – how can we make Britain more attractive? Miliband: One of the problems Britain faces is that when it comes to small firms scaling up, with Apple and Intel, it was government programmes, small business investment, which helped them to grow from their early stages. So weve been talking about different ideas to provide that investment to growing firms.    Updated at 11.46am BST     11.30am BST       Nick Robinson of the BBC: Are you saying Google/Apple/Amazon are the banks of now, isnt the PM doing the right thing trying to change tax? Miliband: Theres a culture of irresponsibility among some of the biggest companies, we cant lecture on benefits and responsibility if the biggest companies arent. To David Cameron Im saying, put your proposals on the table; hes not putting them there. Secondly, youve got to be willing to say youll act here at home. Thirdly, he did the wrong thing in not talking to Eric Schmidt about it on Monday. Thats why the PM isnt going to do the right thing on this issue.    Updated at 11.48am BST     11.29am BST       Miliband says Commercial pressure can have an impact, consumer pressure can have an impact. (Im not so sure. Examples? Has Vodafone changed anything?) If he would act unilaterally, would that put UK at a disadvantage when companies are looking to base companies? (eg Dublin seems to win) He replies: That is the judgment youve got to make. I dont agree that companies wont locate or be in Britain ... In the end youve got to do the right thing. Look at what the banks were saying – dont regulate us, or well leave the country. Im not saying thats going to happen in the internet world but I think we have to think about it.    Updated at 11.31am BST     11.26am BST    Miliband Q+A    Asked what he would actually do: Take a company like Google, its deeply committed to Britain for commercial reasons. I dont think Googles about to leave the country. Governments have more power than they realise in what they can do. But you also have to work internationally.       11.22am BST    Miliband winds up    I started with my dad; Ill end with him too. He came as a Jewish refugee and joined the Royal Navy. He said it was about people coming together for a common purpose. Thats how countries succeed. The only way we come through the storm is through that idea of responsibility shared. I call that One Nation – you can hear the capitals – and thats the country I want to build for us all.    Updated at 11.25am BST     11.20am BST    'Google needs to do the right thing'    Do tax responsibilities lie in obeying the letter of the law? No. I refer you to the letter written [in 2004] by Page and Brin. (Reads extract from the 2004 letter on flotation.) What do I take out of that? A company and its employees expect it to do the right thing. As a society we need to set the right examples from the top ... Google needs to do the right thing.  (Very neat to use Googles S-1 filing ahead of its 2004 flotation.) I cant be the only person to think that a great company like Google that makes billions of pounds in revenue – cant think its fair to pay a fraction of 1% of that in tax. Im sorry Eric Schmidt isnt here to hear me say this. When Eric Schmidt says its just capitalism, I disagree. When Google goes to extraordinary lengths to avoid paying its taxes, I say its wrong. (Very strong words from Miliband there – especially digging at Schmidt.)    Updated at 11.23am BST     11.17am BST       Responsibility of government is to set the right laws ... Government should be arguing for country-by-country transparency so we know how much tax is being paid country by country and company by company. We need to reform the rules on transfer pricing, the crazy rules that allow transfer of profits. And crack down on tax havens. A Labour government would be willing to act on its own.    Updated at 11.18am BST     11.16am BST       Working with companies ... to design the next wave of technology. Now sometimes the private sector can stop the smaller firms being pushed aside by larger firms. Take the example of Google providing Android as open source – that opened up the market to small firms. (Er, not sure about this. Samsung and the many dwarfs.) The British Library, the BBC ... the old idea of the British Library is you go along to a dusty building ... the public sector needs to do more on open access. We also need to make sure there are better returns on creativity ... and then there is regulation, weve got to prevent monopoly and make sure we dont stifle innovation. Weve put forward the idea of a digital ombudsman, who would advise government and work with the proper regulators on emerging technologies. If responsible capitalism is to work then the opportunities cant be grabbed by large firms. Responsible capitalism also needs responsible companies. That takes me to the issue of tax which has been controversial in the past few days, not just for Google.    Updated at 11.20am BST     11.13am BST       Think of Sir Jony Ive, incredibly famous designer, and what hes done at Apple. (Shiver through the Google tent.) Christmas at the Ive household when he was a child was spending a day at the design classroom. We dont just want our children using Google and Facebook, we want them designing. We would put creativity back at the heart of the curriculum, not downgrading it as this government is doing. (Ah, politics at last.)       11.12am BST       That is the big question facing the world. What can we in Britain do to make sure we dont leave people behind and arent left behind as a country. There are millions of people - I know this is hard to believe - whove never used the internet. Its not just bad for them, its bad for the country as well. Weve got to turn it round for their sake and the sake of the country. But its not just about access.       11.09am BST    Miliband getting tougher on Google...    I pay tribute to what Google has done ... youre used to politicians coming along and saying the internets great... while the internet can take us to a more responsible capitalism it can also take us to a more irresponsible one as well. The digital divide is something we all know about ... It can create new vested interests, powerful vested interests. Its great we connect people but what if we allow global footloose companies to escape their responsibilities. Thats something government has a responsibility to resolve.    Updated at 11.14am BST     11.08am BST       We can have irresponsible capitalism ... or responsible where we all face up to our responsibilities. Those are the choices we face. (OK, but how are you going to change the tax laws to make that happen?) Responsible capitalism is a fair society ... lets talk about the internet in this context. The immediate thought is the internet takes us to the more responsible, nor irresponsible capitalism. It opens up access to markets, microfinance, when it comes to opening opportunity ... it breaks down hierarchies – ask anyone in politics or the media. And connects people across the world. And Googles been in the forefront of this.    Updated at 11.15am BST     11.05am BST    Odd one out explained    Milibands father was the odd one out because he was a Marxist professor... He talks about constituent in a cleaning service who pays a living wage to employees. He cites Dr Muhammad Yunus, creator of Microfinance. And he uses Montgomery Burns from the Simpsons to illustrate the problems of free enterprise.    Updated at 11.22am BST     11.02am BST    Hello, Mr Miliband    Miliband: My kids would be delighted to know Im after the killer robots and before the captain of the moonshots. Four pictures - his father Ralph, a Marxist professor; Willy Wonka (gave away the factory); Margaret Hodge, Labour chair of the Commons public accounts committee; Google. Whos the odd one out?    Updated at 11.10am BST     10.57am BST    And now, it's time for Ed Miliband....    Jon Snow is just busking for a moment or two ahead of Ed Miliband coming on to the stage. And now a video about the Global Impact Challenge.  Theyre also getting the robot off the stage. Dont want to have any confusion about whos doing the talking when the LLP comes up.    Updated at 11.00am BST     10.55am BST       If you want to see Meyers robot, its here on Instagram.       10.49am BST       The talk turns to the possibility of hacking peoples embedded systems in order to kill them (my hand was hacked! Thats why I strangled him!). It sounds a bit Dr Strangelove-esque. But Meyer is at least acknowledging the reality.  Sharkey has a slightly told you so look.    Updated at 11.00am BST     10.43am BST    Robots: killer or not?    The first session, moderated by Jon Snow of Channel 4 News, includes Bertolt Meyer, Noel Sharkey, and Carole CadWalladr, talking about killer robots, good robots, and so on. Bertolt Meyer from the University of Zurich is showing us a robot which incorporates all the extras that we can add to people - cochlear implants, skull implants, artificial hands, artificial hands. He speaks from some experience as he was born without a left hand. Noel Sharkey of Stop The Killer Robots is also on stage - but he is concerned he says about killer drones rather than killer robots bearing optical implants. Carole Cadwalladr, Observer feature writer, points out that its the people who have more money who will get more access - my moment of epiphany was when I saw Sergey Brin with his Google Glasses on, and they tested your mindpower - how well you could focus - and he was pretty much top. Theyre going to turn him into a semi-cyborg whereas Ill put them on and they wont increase my capabilities. Theyll just increase the inequality of welfare, I feel the cost of that will be increased by access to technology. Moderator Jon Snow: but everything introduced has done that. NS: using robots that make the decision to kill people muddies the water. We can just about tell the difference between a human and a car at the moment.       10.42am BST    The Big Tent unveils    Googles Big Tent is an annual UK event at which it tries to get the great and the good, and also the media, to talk about its visions for where everything is going in technology. This year it has an extra spice: Ed Miliband, leader of the Labour party, will be here later to talk about tax. And so will Eric Schmidt, Googles chairman.    Updated at 10.54am BST
