   Good to meet you … Barrie Armitt    I am 54 this year and I live in Liverpool. I have taught English to 11- to 18-year-olds for 25 years, and I am hoping to retire soon. At 17 I went into an army school and came out at 18 before going to Newcastle University to study English. I was a teacher of English as a foreign language to adults in Macedonia just as the war was coming to an end – an interesting experience. I am a keen birdwatcher and love playing the guitar. I am very interested in news and current affairs, and if you mention a subject I will always want to engage with it. I have always been a reader of the Guardian, as its political alliance and stance on social issues have often echoed my own views. Some of the writers I used to like seem a bit out of touch with certain social affairs, but more and more I identify with the younger writers, such as Owen Jones and Marina Hyde, who offer a fresh perspective. Im a regular reader of Larry Elliott for economics and think Ben Goldacre is great at breaking down numbers and presenting the facts. I find them at the top end of investigative journalism, and I was extremely impressed by the Edward Snowden stories. Despite my criticisms, it is the first thing I read in the morning and the last thing I check in the evening – so that says something!
