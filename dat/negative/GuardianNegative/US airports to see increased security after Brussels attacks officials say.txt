US airports to see increased security after Brussels attacks, officials say

Authorities are set to bolster security at American airports and other transit hubs in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Brussels, although officials say they do not have credible intelligence about terrorism in the United States.  The Transportation Security Administration will send additional personnel and security measures “to major city airports in the United States, and at various rail and transit stations around the country”, announced Jeh Johnson, the US secretary of homeland security, who called it a “precautionary measure” rather than a response to a specific threat.

While Belgians do not require visas to enter the country, Johnson expressed confidence in the DHS’s ability to spot suspicious individuals through the overlapping, much-criticized Terrorist Screening Database. “We continually evaluate whether more screening is necessary, particularly in light of today’s attacks,” Johnson said, adding that the department would continue to facilitate sharing intelligence with the Belgians and throughout federal, state and local law enforcement. “There are also a number of other security measures we are taking that are not suitable for public disclosure,” Johnson said. Reports suggest at least nine Americans were among more than 250 wounded in the complex assault in which multiple attackers, believed to be suicide bombers, detonated explosives at Brussels’ Zaventem airport and a metro station. There are not thought to be any Americans among the dead. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints said in an official release that three missionaries, all from Utah, were seriously injured. The missionaries were named as Richard Norby, 66, Joseph Empey, 20, and Mason Wells, 19. The US military command in Europe said it was aware of “one US service member and his family who were caught up in this tragedy at the Brussels airport”, but did not identify the wounded service member.  US officials confirmed the injured man was an air force lieutenant colonel, whose wife and four children were also injured in the attack at the Brussels airport. US European Command also prohibited unofficial travel to Brussels, the seat of Nato headquarters, on Tuesday, but personnel currently assigned to the city are unaffected.

On Friday, Belgian law enforcement shot and captured Salah Abdeslam, a suspect in November’s terrorist assault on Paris, after a months-long manhunt. The ability of the culprits to pull off a coordinated attack even as Belgium remained on an elevated threat level raised immediate questions about the strength of security perimeters around transportation hubs such as airports and rail stations – whether, in an age of terrorism, they represent a contemporary Maginot Line that determined attackers will defeat. Patrick Skinner, a former CIA and law enforcement official, said expanding or bolstering security perimeters was worthwhile, but primarily for keeping an attacker off a plane or a train, not preventing a mass-casualty attack. Determined attackers “can pick wherever the security is kicking in and that’s where they’re going to hit”, he said, arguing for a more active security approach. “The model of ‘raid early, raid often’ is going to be needed,” said Skinner, now with the Soufan Group, a security consultancy. “If you can get a warrant, whatever country you’re in, you hit them, keep them off balance. If they’re running they’re not shooting, and if they’re hiding they’re not shooting.” Skinner cautioned that staging raids could lead to more attacks, “but they could be hurried attacks”. “There are no good answers right now,” he said.           Brussels terror attacks: how events unfolded – video explainer    In the US, the most visible changes to security at public locales will probably come not from federal instruction but from the initiatives of local police and airports, the latter of which has responsibility for site security. According to security experts, there will not be wholesale shifts in security procedures at transit hubs, but instead a varied approach depending on credible threat reports. Police in Chicago, Washington DC and New York City said that while there was no known threat directed at the cities, they would ramp up police presence, especially at airports, public transit systems and other high-profile locations. Washington’s Metro transit police said there would be an increased presence though there is no “known, specific or credible threat” to the transit system. The Port Authority, which manages New York-area airports, bridges, tunnels and trains, said it was stepping up security at such locations and was also conducting bag checks on Path, the commuter train between the city and New Jersey. It was also “employing high-visibility anti-terrorist patrols on the Path system” and at the World Trade Center site. New York City police were in contact with international partners and the FBI. While the department waited to learn more, it had deployed additional counter-terrorism resources in the city. “These teams have been deployed to crowded areas and transit locations around the city out of an abundance of caution to provide police presence and public reassurance as we closely follow the developing situation overseas,” said Stephen Davis, the New York police department’s deputy commissioner of public information. Johnson, the homeland security chief, urged public vigilance, requesting Americans report suspicious behavior to the authorities “As I have said many times, ‘If You See Something, Say Something’ is more than a slogan,” Johnson said.
