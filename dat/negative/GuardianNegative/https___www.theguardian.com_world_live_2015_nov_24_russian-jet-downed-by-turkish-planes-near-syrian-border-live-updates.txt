  7.17pm GMT       Russia has also now put out its own image in an attempt to counter the radar picture provided earlier by Turkey (See 10.26). While the Turkish image appeared to show that the Russian jet briefly flew over southern Turkey before it as shot down, Russia’s suggests that there has been no airspace violation. Warning that we’re headed for the territory surrounding the recriminations over the shooting down last year of a Malaysian airline over Ukraine, Moscow-based Alec Luhn tweets:    Russia counters Turkish radar pic with flight map showing no airspace violation.

Updated at 7.19pm GMT     7.07pm GMT       There has been abundance of images today surrounding the downed Russian jet, which has generated suspicions among some. Lindsey Hilsum, Channel 4 News International Editor, asks:     How come a Turkish TV crew was in the right place, filming in the right direction as Russian plane shot down? Lucky? Or tipped off? Lindsey Hilsum (@lindseyhilsum) November 24, 2015         7.05pm GMT       Elsewhere in the same conflict zone, an Assyrian group has said that the Islamic State (Isis) militant group have released 10 more Assyrian Christian hostages they had held captive in Syria since February. The Associated Press reports:  The 10 were part of more than 220 Assyrian Christians captured by the extremist group after it overran communities on the southern bank of Khabur River in the northeastern Syrian province of Hassakeh. The Assyrian Network for Human Rights said the 10 were released on Tuesday and that they are all in good condition. The Stockholm-based network says there are five women among the released. It says the release brings the number of Assyrian hostages that have so far been released to 98.  The network also says the release was the result of ongoing mediation efforts by the head of the Assyrian Church of the East in Syria.        7.00pm GMT       More now from the Russian military, and about that new statement that a marine on a helicopter sent in to search for the crew of the downed jet also died. Russia’s military general staff is quoted by Russian news agencies as saying that one of the pilots of the Su-24 warplane that was shot down by Turkey was killed by groundfire as he parachuted from his crippled plane. General staff spokesman Lt. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, added that rebels in Syria fired on a Russian helicopter that was searching for the two pilots of the Su-24. The shooting killed one crew member on the Mi-8 helicopter and forced it to land in neutral territory, he says. The rest of the crew was evacuated. Rudskoi also said that Russian radar data showed that Turkish warplanes had violated Syrian airspace in the course of shooting down the Russian plane       6.54pm GMT       When Putin labeled Turkey “accomplices of terrorists,” he was hinting at complex relationship which includes links between senior Isis figures and Turkish officials, explains the Guardian’s Martin Chulov in this analysis.  Turkey’s international airports have also been busy. Many, if not most, of the estimated 15,000-20,000 foreign fighters to have joined the Islamic State (Isis) have first flown into Istanbul or Adana, or arrived by ferry along its Mediterranean coast. The influx has offered fertile ground to allies of Assad who, well before a Turkish jet shot down a Russian fighter on Tuesday, had enabled, or even supported Isis. Vladimir Putin’s reference to Turkey as “accomplices of terrorists” is likely to resonate even among some of Ankara’s backers. From midway through 2012, when jihadis started to travel to Syria, their presence was apparent at all points of the journey to the border.  At Istanbul airport, in the southern cities of Hatay and Gaziantep – both of which were staging points – and in the border villages. Foreigners on their way to fight remained fixtures on these routes until late in 2014 when, after continued pressure from the EU states and the US, coordinated efforts were made to turn them back.  Read on here    Updated at 7.10pm GMT     6.34pm GMT    Russia: Marine on rescue helicopter died    Russian journalists are being given a briefing by the defence ministry, I’m told by the Guardian’s Shaun Walker in Moscow. These are the main lines so far as reported by RIA Novosti:  One of the two pilots has died, from “fire from the ground”. The fate of the second pilot remains unclear. A helicopter sent to rescue the pilots was hit, performed an emergency landing, and one of the marines on board died. Military contacts with Turkey will be severed. Russia says Syrian air traffic control shows the Turkish F-16 which shot down the Russian plane violated Syrian airspace.  It’s Ben Quinn here picking up the blog now from Mark.    Updated at 6.37pm GMT     6.24pm GMT       Here is a summary of the Obama-Hollande press conference at the White House. Ben Quinn is now taking over.  The US and France have agreed to step up strikes in Syria and Iraq to target Islamic State, but Hollande said France will not deploy ground forces. They agreed on the importance of closing the Turkish border to limit the movement of extremists into Europe.  Obama said Turkey had the right to defend its territory and air space. He says the downing of the Russian warplane by Turkey points to an “ongoing problem” with Russia’s airstrikes in Syria. If Russia would instead concentrate its airstrikes on the Islamic State group, he said, then mistakes would be “less likely to occur.” Both criticised Russia for hitting moderate Syrian opposition forces, which they said only bolster President Bashar al-Assad’s government. Hollande would not provide a date for Assad’s transition from power but said it must be “as soon as possible.”  They urged Turkey and Russia to talk directly to prevent any escalation. The White House said the incursion lasted only seconds. Nato officials said Turkish aircraft could have escorted the plane out of Turkey.        6.10pm GMT       In this video, a deputy commander of rebel Turkmen forces in Syria says his men shot at two Russian pilots after they ejected from their jet. He also claims to show parts of a Russian military parachute. Both Russia and its ally, the Syrian government, have carried out strikes in the area where the plane came down.                   6.04pm GMT    Russian military: one pilot is dead    The Russians have contradicted Turkish claims that both Russian pilots are alive. The Russian military general staff says one of the men is dead, reports the RIA news agency.    Updated at 6.44pm GMT     5.59pm GMT       In Brussels, Nato officials say the Russian jet entered Turkish airspace before it was shot down. Earlier the US said the Russian incursion into Turkish air space lasted just seconds. Nato ambassadors apparently believe Turkey could have shown more restraint. This from Reuters.  Diplomats present at the meeting told Reuters that while none of the 28 Nato envoys defended Russia’s actions, many expressed concern that Turkey did not escort the Russian warplane out of its airspace. “There are other ways of dealing with these kinds of incidents,” said one diplomat who declined to be named.      Updated at 6.13pm GMT     5.49pm GMT       Hollande says strikes must be against Daesh and stresses the need to resolve the Syria crisis, which is relevant not just to Syria’s neighbours but the wider world as refugees leave the region. The French president stresses France will not deploy ground troops as that is up to local forces. Obama says the US is backing local forces with training and equipment as well as launching air strikes. He says the Vienna process, which includes Iran (also backers of Assad) for the first time, is the best option.       5.34pm GMT    Obama: 'Turkey and Russia must talk and de-escalate'    On the downing of the Russian plane, Obama says it has the right to defend its territory and its airspace, and stresses the importance of Turkey and Russia working to de-escalate the situation. He says if Russia concentrates on Isis there would be fewer chances of mistakes. “The problem has been Russia’s focus on propping up Assad rather than concentrating on Isil.”       5.30pm GMT    Hollande: 'Assad must go'    Hollande expresses his gratitude to the US, says Obama was the first leader to call him after the Paris attacks. He says Isis has territory and considerable resources and has hit several different countries, including Russia. “We have decided to scale up our strikes against Isis in Syria and Iraq,” says Hollande, who adds that the recent UN security council resolution gives support to the coalition against Daesh, another name for Isis. He says Assad has to go because he is responsible for most of the deaths in Syria. On the refugee crisis, Hollande says a solution has to be found with Turkey that allows refugees to stay close to home. He says France can work with Russia if it concentrates on hitting Isis. Hollande is due in Moscow on Thursday to see Vladimir Putin, who is of course firmly behind Assad. This is one of the biggest points of contention in the Vienna process.       5.16pm GMT    Obama: 'we will win and groups like Isil will lose'    Obama again criticises Russia. He says Russian strikes against moderate opposition only bolster Assad and Isis, which he refers to as Isil. He reiterates the need to move away from Syrian president Assad in the Vienna talks. “They can’t defeat us on the battlefield, we cannot allow fear to divide us.” He says duties to security and to refugees go hand in hand. Obama cites past threats, world wars, cold war when the west prevailed. “It’ll be no different this time, we will win and groups like Isil will lose.”    Updated at 5.38pm GMT     5.07pm GMT    Obama: 'attack on Paris, an attack on world itself'    President Obama has just started a joint press conference with his French counterpart Francois Hollande at the White House. Calling France America’s oldest ally, he pays tribute to its culture and its joie de vivre. He happy memories of being in Paris with Michelle, including them kissing in the Jardin de Luxembourg. “Nous sommes tous Francais.” He says the attacks in Paris as an assault on the world itself. He claims that 8,000 airstrikes have pushed back Isis.       4.53pm GMT       Reuters is reporting that a Tunisian military bus carrying presidential guards has been hit by an explosion in central Tunis. Tunisia has suffered a couple of devastating attacks recently, including the massacre of tourists on a beach and the assault on the Bardo museum. Six people are reported dead.    Updated at 4.56pm GMT     4.45pm GMT    White House: 'Russian incursion into Turkish airspace lasted seconds'    Russia’s operation in Syria will continue despite the downing of a Russian fighter jet by the Turkish air force, the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. Meanwhile, a US official has said that initial indications are that the Russian incursion into Turkish airspace lasted a matter of seconds.       4.38pm GMT    Turkish official: 'Two Russian pilots still alive'    Despite earlier reports that the two pilots are dead, a Turkish official has told Reuters otherwise.  Turkey believes the two pilots from a Russian war plane it shot down close to the Syrian border on Tuesday are still alive and is working to secure their release from Syrian rebels, a Turkish government official told Reuters. “Our units, who received the information that the two pilots were alive, are working to get them from opposition rebels safely,” the official said.        4.32pm GMT       While EU president Donald Tusk appeals for calm, Russia and Turkey might choose to up the ante. Analysts Ege Seckin and Firas Abi Ali from IHS Country Risk consider the options for both.  In the medium term, Russia and Turkey both have escalation options against one another. Russia can increase the price of Russian gas, while Turkey can provide support to insurgents within Russian Caucasian republics and in Crimea. Russia is also likely to retaliate indirectly by increasing support for the Syrian-Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its Turkey-based counterpart, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).        4.15pm GMT    Russian plane 'acting against militants originating from Russia'    More from the Russian defence ministry, which follows Putin’s comments (see 13.02) that the Russian jet was taking action against militants originally from Russia.  “The Russian operations were against illegal terrorist formations mainly made up of fighters from Russia’s North Caucasus region… Attempts by Russian defence ministry specialists to make emergency contact with their Turkish counterparts were unsuccessful… The ministry is currently working out a range of measures to react to this kind of incident… Military operations against terrorists in Syria will continue.”     Updated at 4.20pm GMT     3.53pm GMT       On the diplomatic front, French president Francois Hollande has begun talks with Barack Obama at the White House. Hollande is seeking support for increased military action against Islamic State after the atrocities in Paris that left 130 dead. He received David Cameron at the Elysee palace yesterday. Hollande, who is to go on to Russia, has pleaded for the US and Russia to set aside their policy differences over Syria and “fight this terrorist army in a broad, single coalition”.    Updated at 4.09pm GMT     3.42pm GMT       Here is some historical background on past aerial clashes between the west and its allies and the Soviet Union.  No Nato country has shot down a Russian warplane since the end of the cold war, but there have been many incidents involving the west and the then Soviet Union. In the most high-profile case, Gary Powers’ U2 spy plane was shot down by Sam-2 anti-aircraft missiles in 1960. When the US refused to apologise, plans for a superpower summit in Paris collapsed. Powers was eventually swapped for a Soviet spy.  During the Korean war, there were several dogfights between Americans and Soviet pilots flying Migs in Chinese and North Korean markings. The last recorded downings of Soviet planes by US pilots came in November, 1952 when four Migs-15s were shot down during American air strikes against the North Korean port of Hoeryong, near the major Soviet base at Vladivostok.  Captain Royce Williams, a US Navy pilot, was credited with shooting down three of the Migs, possibly the fourth as well. During the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, Pakistani pilots flying American-made F-16s shot down at least 10 Soviet aircraft in the late 1980s.        3.30pm GMT    Russian state tourism agency recommends suspension of Turkish tours    Russia’s state tourism agency Rostourism is recommending suspending sales of tour packages to Turkey the Russian RIA news agency reports.       3.24pm GMT       It’s a tough day for Moscow. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports that Syrian fighters destroyed a Russian helicopter with a missile, shortly after they forced it to make an emergency landing in a nearby government-held area in Syria’s Latakia province. A Syrian insurgent group, which receives US Tow missiles, said its fighters hit the helicopter with an anti-tank missile while it was in the air and put out a video showing the helicopter being blown up after one of its fighters struck it with another missile.   Rami Abdulrahman from the Observatory said at least 10 people were on the helicopter when it was hit but they were all evacuated when it landed and before the missile destroyed it.        3.19pm GMT       Donald Tusk, EU president, has called for calm. The former Polish prime minister is due to host a EU summit with Turkey in Brussels on Sunday which was supposed to deal with the refugee crisis.    In this dangerous moment after downing of Russian jet, all should remain cool headed and calm Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) November 24, 2015         2.51pm GMT    Lavrov cancels planned visit to Turkey       Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images    No great surprise this, but Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has cancelled a planned visit to Turkey.  Lavrov was due to visit Ankara on Wednesday for bilateral talks. Turkish officials had insited it would go ahead as planned.  Lavrov, speaking to reporters in the southern Russian city of Sochi, advised Russians not to visit Turkey and said the threat of terrorism there was the no less than in Egypt, where a bomb attack brought down a Russian passenger plane last month.  One of the possible retaliatory measures Russia could take would be ban flights to Turkey, as Moscow did with Egypt after the Metrojet bombing over Sinai last month, writes Shaun Walker. There are dozens of flights a day between the two countries, so such a move would undoubtedly seriously affect trade and tourism. (That’s it from me. I’m handling the live blog over to Mark Tran).    Updated at 2.57pm GMT     2.40pm GMT       Don’t be too alarmed by Putin’s tough talking, cautions Russia analyst and New York University professor Mark Galeotti. In a blogpost on his first thought about the incident, he says:   I suspect neither Moscow nor, at the very least, the other European Nato powers will want to let this go too far. Russia cannot fight hot diplomatic wars on too many fronts, and Europe clearly wants Moscow to be part of the solution in Syria and maybe Ukraine, too. And, frankly, there is in many capitals concern about Turkey, its agenda and its role in the region. Much will depend on where Washington falls, of course, but if Moscow can get even a crumb of contrition from Ankara or sympathy from Europe, then we can expect this to be splashed on Russian TV and allow the Kremlin to let this slide a little. But even in this best-case scenario, I don’t imagine that will be the end to it. Moscow has already been willing to operate inside Turkey covertly, and is engaged in political tussles over influence in the South Caucasus as well as Middle East. I would expect some uptick in ‘mischief’ – perhaps some support for the Kurds or other violent extreme movements, for example – as well as a more assiduous campaign to push back and stymie Turkish regional ambitions. It’s often said, with good reason, that Putin really wants a return to 19th century geopolitics, when might made right and realpolitik was all. Let’s not forget that one of the defining 19thcentury conflicts was that between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, which were sometimes openly at war, sometimes ostensibly at peace, but never anything than enemies. Here we go again.        2.33pm GMT       Shaun Walker reports more sabre-rattling in Moscow. Writing on Twitter Alexei Pushkov, the head of the Russian parliament’s international relations committee, said: “Ankara clearly did not weigh the consequences of its hostile acts for Turkey’s interests and economy. The consequences will be very serious.”    Анкара явно не просчитала последствий своих враждебных действий для интересов Турции и ее экономики. Последствия будут очень серьезные.

PA reports the exchange:  Hammond insisted Turkey will remain a “very important partner” for the UK, hours after it shot down a Russian war plane near the Syria border. Labour’s Dennis Skinner pressed Hammond for his views on Turkey’s role agains Islamic State following the incident.  He also accused Turkey of buying oil from the terror group, “in order to prop them up”.  Hammond replied: “I see old habits die hard and you remain an apologist for Russian actions. On the question of Turkey, Turkey is an important Nato ally.  “It holds the key to a number of really very important questions, both in relation to the battle against Isil but also in relation to the migration challenge that Europe faces, and it will remain a very important partner for this country and for the European Union.”  Skinner had asked Hammond: “Do you regard Turkey as a reliable ally in the battle against Isil [Isis]? “When you consider that not only today that they’ve shot down a Russian jet - who are also trying to fight Isil - they’re buying oil from Isil in order to prop them up, they’re bombing the Kurds who are also fighting Isil.  “This Syrian engagement is an almighty mess.”         2.04pm GMT       Turkey’s news agency Dogan repeats reports that Turkmen commanders have stated that their forces shot both Russian pilots while they were parachuting down, and that they have the bodies. This is also unconfirmed. There have been conflicting reports about the fate of the pilots. One appeared to be dead in disturbing and unverified video footage.     Updated at 2.05pm GMT     1.59pm GMT       There are unconfirmed reports by Syrian rebels that a Russia helicopter has been shot over Syria’s Latakia province while trying to recover the pilots of the downed jet.

Davutoglu said:   “We want the international community to know that we are ready for any kind of sacrifice when the security and life of our citizens and our border security are concerned. The downing of a jet that had violated Turkish airspace today has to be seen in this context as well.  “We do not adopt an approach that impeaches on the sovereignty of any country. But the world needs to know that it is our international right and our national duty to take measures against anybody who violates our borders on the land and in the air, in spite of our many warnings.”        1.39pm GMT       Here are the key quotes from Putin’s statement:  “The loss today is a stab in the back, carried out by the accomplices of terrorists. I can’t describe it in any other way.”   “Our aircraft was downed over the territory of Syria, using air-to-air missile from a Turkish F-16. It fell on the Syrian territory 4km from Turkey.”   “Neither our pilots nor our jet threatened the territory of Turkey.”   “Today’s tragic event will have significant consequences, including for Russia-Turkish relations ... Instead of immediately getting in contact with us, as far as we know, the Turkish side immediately turned to their partners from Nato to discuss this incident, as if we shot down their plane and not they ours.”   “Do they want to make Nato serve ISIS? ... We hope that the international community will find the strength to come together and fight against the common evil.”        1.24pm GMT    Summary    Here’s a summary of where things currently stand amid conflicting versions of exactly what happened and terse verbal exchanges between Russia and Turkey.  Russia’s president Vladimir Putin has warned Turkey of ‘serious consequences’ after a Russia fighter jet was shot down close to Turkey’s border with Syria. Putin described the incident as a “stab in the back” and accused Turkey of siding with Islamic State militants in Syria. Turkey has summoned Russia’s envoy in Ankara and said it had a right to defend its territory. A Turkish official said: “This isn’t an action against any specific country: Our F-16s took necessary steps to defend Turkey’s sovereign territory.” The Turkish military said it shot down the plane after it penetrated Turkish airspace in the province of Hatay at 9.20am warning it to leave 10 times in five minutes before it was shot down. Turkey published radar images claiming to show the plane briefly flying over its southern territory. Russia said its SU-24 plane never left Syrian airspace. Putin said it came down 4km from the border with Turkey and did not pose a threat to Turkey.  Video footage showed the pilots parachuting out of the plane before it crashed. An anti-Assad rebel group in Syria said both pilots were killed after parachuting from the jet. This has yet to be confirmed.  Turkey is to brief fellow Nato members about the incident at an extraordinary meeting in Brussels at 1600 GMT. The meeting was requested by Turkey.     Map showing the location of the downed Russian warplane Map showing the location of the downed Russian warplane        1.12pm GMT       Putin added this provocative comment at the end of his statement.  Do they want to make Nato serve ISIS? I understand that every state has its own regional interests and we’ve always respected that, but we will never allow the kind of crime that happened to today to take place. And of course we hope that the international community will find the strength to come together and fight against the common evil.        1.02pm GMT    Putin warns of 'significant consequences'       Vladimir Putin Photograph: Xinhua/REX Shutterstock    Putin warns Turkey of “significant consequences”.  Speaking ahead of his meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan in Sochi, the Russian leader said:  This event is beyond the normal framework of fighting against terrorism. Of course our military is doing heroic work against terrorism... But the loss today is a stab in the back, carried out by the accomplices of terrorists. I can’t describe it in any other way. Our aircraft was downed over the territory of Syria, using air-to-air missile from a Turkish F-16. It fell on the Syrian territory 4km from Turkey.  Neither our pilots nor our jet threatened the territory of Turkey. This is obvious. They are fighting terrorists in the northern areas around Latakia, where militants are located, mainly people who originated in Russia, and they were pursuing their direct duty, to make sure these people do not return to Russia. These are people who are clearly international terrorists. Taking into account that we signed an agreement on deconflicting with the US, and as we know Turkey was among the ones that has joined the US coalition. Since Isis has such huge resources of hundreds of millions and billions of dollars coming from illicit oil sales, and they are protected by the armed forces of other states, then it’s clear why they are so brazen, why they are killing people, why they are carrying out terrorist attacks throughout the world including in the heart of Europe. We will analyse everything, and today’s tragic event will have significant consequences, including for Russia-Turkish relations. We have always treated Turkey as a friendly state. I don’t know who was interested in what happened today, certainly not us. And instead of immediately getting in contact with us, as far as we know, the Turkish side immediately turned to their partners from Nato to discuss this incident, as if we shot down their plane and not they ours.     Updated at 1.08pm GMT     12.58pm GMT       Turkey prime minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, speaking at the same time as Putin, insisted it Turkey had a right to respond to violations of its airspace.        12.55pm GMT    Putin describes incident as a 'stab in the back'    Vladimir Putin said the loss of the jet “is a stab in the back, carried out by the accomplices of terrorists”. In his first comments on the incident he said: “I can’t describe it in any other way.” The Russian President said the jet was downed 4km inside Syria. He claimed the pilots were not a threat.  He claimed that large amount of oil from militants in Syria end up in Syria.       12.50pm GMT    'Both pilots killed'    There are unconfirmed reports that both pilots were killed after parachuting from the Russian jet. Charles Lister, analyst from BrookingsDoha, said both pilots were killed citing an anti-Assad rebel source.

Updated at 4.57pm GMT     12.34pm GMT       The downing of the Russian jet has sparked grave concerns in Greece, Turkey’s neighbour and for years its Nato rival, reports Helena Smith in Athens.   Diplomats are expressing thinly disguised alarm. In a country, which frequently complains of Turkish fighter jets both violating and buzzing Greek airspace over the Aegean, the shooting of the SU-24 is being described by diplomats in private “as an extremely serious incident” that has prompted “high concern.”  “This is the first time since the beginning of the cold war that a member of Nato destroys a Russian military aircraft,” said one. “It is an extremely serious incident. There is high concern [in Athens].”      Updated at 12.39pm GMT     12.12pm GMT       Ankara had made it very clear to Russia it was unhappy with Russian military activities close to its border, and even summoned the Russian ambassador and military attaché last Friday to make a complaint, Turkey’s Hurriyet reported this morning writes Shaun Walker.   The newspaper said the Turks warned the Russian ambassador they would retaliate and take necessary measures if their border security was threatened by operations against Turkmen Syrians close to the border. Turkish officials told the diplomats that Turkmen civilians were suffering as a result of Russian operations, and said the proximity to the Turkish border meant there was a possibility of a violation of Turkey’s border security. “It should be noted Turkey’s rules of engagement were in place and there will be no hesitation to implement them if such a violation occurs,” the Russians were told, Hurriyet claimed.         12.08pm GMT    Nato confirms meeting    Nato has confirmed it will hold an extraordinary council meeting on Turkey’s request. Here’s its statement:  At the request of Turkey, the North Atlantic Council will hold an extraordinary meeting at 17.00 (Brussels time). The aim of this extraordinary NAC meeting is for Turkey to inform allies about the downing of a Russian airplane. Nato is monitoring the situation closely. We are in close contact with Turkish authorities.  It pointed out that the meeting would not fall under the article 4 of the Washington treaty under which Nato member discuss a threat to territorial integrity, political indendence or security. A spokesaman said: “The fact that this is not an Article 4 meeting but purely one for information, suggests that Turkey and Nato want to make sure this does not escalate out of control.”     #NATO Ambassadors will gather to discuss the downing of the #Russian jet today, no Article 4 invoked estNATO (@estNATO) November 24, 2015      Updated at 12.10pm GMT     12.03pm GMT       Nihat Ali Özcan, security expert at the Ankara-based Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey, fears a harsh response from Russia.   “It is very bad news for Turkey that a Russian jet was shot down. Putin will not leave this unanswered, he might retaliate in different ways, for example by cutting off Turkey’s natural gas supply from Russia over the winter. He might also choose to reply in kind, in a similarly aggressive manner in Syria. But one thing is certain: Putin will not stand for this, we have difficult days ahead of us.”        11.58am GMT       A spokesman for the Syrian rebel group which claimed to have captured a Russian pilot whose plane was shot down over northwestern Syria says he was dead upon landing, AP reports.    Jahed Ahmad of the 10th Brigade in the Coast said that the two Russian crew members tried to land in their parachutes in government-held areas after they ejected, but came under fire from members of his group.  He adds that rebels shot one of the pilots, who landed dead on the ground on Tuesday.  The fate of the second pilot was not immediately known.  The group released a video showing gunmen standing around a blond pilot whose face was bruised and appeared dead.        11.55am GMT       Reza Afshar, a former Foreign Office official in charge of Britain’s policy on Syria, predicts that Russia will do “very little” in response.    #Turkey shoots down #Russia plane.

In the wake of the war in Ukraine, Russian military aircraft have been regularly buzzing Western military and civilian flights, over the North Sea, the Baltic states and the English channel. There have been similar incidents involving long-range Russian bombers over the Pacific coast of the US and Canada. In a March 2015 report the European Leadership Network detailed nearly 70 ‘encounters’ in which Russian military aircraft have come close to Nato armed forces or civilian aircraft. It classified three incidents as ‘high risk’, and 13 as ‘serious’.  In December 2014 a Russian aircraft flying with its transponders turned off nearly collided with a SAS airliner near Copenhagen. The second took place in March 2015 when Russian fighter bombers used Nato warships deployed in the Black sea ‘as targets in high intensity training exercises.’ The report says: “The incidents show the confrontation potential of close Russia-Nato military encounters... There are not sufficient dialogue mechanisms in place to manage the fall-out from the possible shoot down of a Russian aircraft.” Nato says it conducted over 400 interceptions of Russian warplanes in 2014, 150 of them over the Baltics. The figure is four times higher than in 2013.      Near misses between Russian and West documented by the European Leadership Network        11.39am GMT       The British-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says Russian helicopters are combing the area where the jet came down in search for the pilots, writes Kareem Shaheen. The jet was shot down near Jabal al-Turkman in northern Latakia, it said. Russia’s military has blocked wireless communications in the area while they search for the pilots, the Observatory claimed.        11.35am GMT        Like the US, Turkey fears Russia’s involvement in Syria will complicate an already fraught situation, prolong the war, and exacerbate the refugee crisis along Turkey’s border, across which more than 2 million Syrians have fled, writes Simon Tisdall.   President Erdogan was said to be especially annoyed that he was not consulted about Russia’s intentions during his visit to Moscow in September when he met President Vladimir Putin.  Turkey has a long history of tension with Russia over unresolved disputes such as Moscow’s support for Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian-controlled breakaway enclave in Azerbaijan. Ottoman Turkey and Tsarist Russia fought a war in 1877-78. And Stalin briefly laid claim to parts of eastern Turkey at the end of the Second World War. But ties have improved in recent times, with a series of energy and trade deals. Russia is now Turkey’s second-largest trading partner and 60% of its natural gas comes from Russia. Economic dependence is one powerful reason, among several, why Erdogan will not want this latest border incident to escalate into a wider confrontation – although this is something that may not be entirely within his control. Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, is due to visit Ankara on Wednesday for bilateral talks. Turkish officials said the visit would go ahead as planned, even as they consult with Nato in Brussels. There will be much to discuss.        11.24am GMT       Nato is to hold an urgent meeting to discuss the downing of the Russian jet, according to the Times’ defence editor Deborah Haynes.     Extraordinary session of @NATOs North Atlantic Council will be held today following Turkeys downing of a Russian jet Deborah Haynes (@haynesdeborah) November 24, 2015      Turkey requested extraordinary @NATO council meeting to inform members of downing of Russian jet.

Deborah Haynes (@haynesdeborah) November 24, 2015      Updated at 11.28am GMT     11.18am GMT    Turkey says it was defending its territory    A Turkish government official has confirmed that the SU-24 was show down by Turk F-16s after being repeatedly warned about entering Turkish airspace. But in a statement he said the military action was not against any specific country but an act of self defence.   “In line with the military rules of engagement [MRoE], the Turkish authorities repeatedly warned an unidentified aircraft that they were 15km or less away from the border. The aircraft didn’t heed the warnings and proceeded to fly over Turkey. The Turkish Air Forces responded by downing the aircraft. “In the past, we have made public our military rules of engagement and reminded our counterparts that any violation of Turkish airspace would trigger the actions prescribed by the MRoE. This isn’t an action against any specific country: Our F-16s took necessary steps to defend Turkey’s sovereign territory.”      File picture of a Turkish Air Force F-16 jet fighter Photograph: Umit Bektas/Reuters      Updated at 11.31am GMT     11.15am GMT       Aaron Stein, the author of a new book, Turkey’s New Foreign Policy, said Moscow miscalculated by repeatedly violating Turkey’s airspace.  “This is the fourth Russian violation of Turkish airspace since they began airstrikes. Turkey’s rules of engagement are clear and well known. Moscow miscalculated. This is obviously a very serious incident. Ankara is likely to try and elevate this and begin formal consultations with Nato. Domestically, the pro-government press has championed the Turkmen cause in Syria and has lambasted Russia’s recent offensive in the area.”     Updated at 11.20am GMT     11.13am GMT       Craig Murray, a former British diplomat turned anti-war campaigner, says Turkey’s actions are unjustified and that the incident highlights the danger of the UK getting involved in the bombing campaign over Syria. Writing on his blog, Murray says:   I calculate that each “incursion” over Turkish territory would have lasted about 10 seconds, assuming the plane was flying slowly at 600mph. That Turkey shot down the plane for this is madness, and absolutely indefensible. It is fairly obvious from the track that the plane was operating against Turkish sponsored Turkmen rebels inside Syria, and that is why the Turks shot it down. But the inescapable conclusion is that the true madness would be for the UK to get involved in Syria and make a complex and volatile situation still worse, and risk being dragged into wider conflict.        11.06am GMT       The deputy speaker of Russia’s parliament, and a member of its international affairs committee, accused Turkey of supporting Islamic State [Isis] and shooting down the Russian plane over Syria, writes Shaun Walker.   In response, he suggested that Russia should cancel flights to Turkey and evacuate all its citizens. Nikolai Levichev compared the attack to the bombing of a Russian Airbus over Sinai last month, apparently carried out by ISIS. The attack killed all 224 people on board and led to the cancellation of all flights between Russia and Egypt. As individual politicians continue to speculate on the response, the real clues as to how aggressively Russia will react are likely to come only when we have heard Vladimir Putin speak.        11.03am GMT       Reuters says it has been sent a copy of that graphic video purporting to show the dead Russian pilot.     BREAKING: Video sent by Syrian rebel group to Reuters claims to show Russian pilot immobile on ground, official from group says he is dead Reuters Top News (@Reuters) November 24, 2015      Updated at 4.57pm GMT     10.55am GMT       Putin, who was in Iran on Monday, has a planned meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan today in Sochi, writes Shaun Walker The Russian president is expected to speak on the Su-24 incident during a press appearance after that. Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov had a visit to Turkey planned tomorrow, there is no word on whether this will go ahead.        10.53am GMT       Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat who is now the chairman of the Edam think tank in Istanbul, says he is surprised an incident likes this hasn’t happened before.  “This was an incident in the making for some time as we have had some near misses in the past few weeks wher Turkey did not fully implement its own rules of engagement.” “There were two airspace violations, and after that a very high level Russian military delegation came to Turkey to talk about it, including a top air force official. They apologised for one of the incidents, saying that in that case the Russian pilot didn’t speak the language. So we thought we had an understanding and solved the problem.” “So it’s a surprise that it happened since that visit,” Ulgen, who is also a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “But it’s not a surprise in terms of Russian strategy. Since the intervention the Russians have been testing the Turkish response at its borders and its rules of engagement. “In this case, the pilot was warned a number of times. First at 13 miles out from the Turkish border, and then at 5 miles out, which is when Turkish jets scramble. It went past all those thresholds,” he said.

RIA Novosti quoted Peskov saying:   “It would be incorrect to make any evaluations or statements until we have the full information. So we just need to show patience. It’s a very serious event. But, without the full information it’s impossible to say anything, it wouldn’t be right.”     Updated at 10.41am GMT     10.35am GMT    Video purporting to show dead Russian pilot    Graphic video purporting to show a dead Russian pilot is being widely circulated, but we cannot verify its authenticity.  BrookingsDoha analyst Charles Lister says the video shows the dead pilot wearing Russian uniform and equipment. He says the dead pilot is now reported to be in the hands of anti-Assad rebels from the Alwiya Al-‘Ashar group.     Updated at 10.38am GMT     10.26am GMT       Turkey has released flight radar images appearing to show that the Russian jet briefly flew over southern Turkey before it as shot down, CNN Turk reports.    #BREAKING Flight radar track on downed warplane issued by Turkish military pic.twitter.com/xREQbclVwK CNN Türk ENG (@CNNTURK_ENG) November 24, 2015         10.21am GMT       Nato officials say that they are in touch with the Turkish authorities, reports Julian Borger, our diplomatic editor. Nato has not said whether they are in touch with Moscow. The New York Times reports that Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, has ordered the foreign ministry to consult with NATO and the United Nations over the episode.  Last week, Turkey summoned the Russian ambassador, Andrei Karlov, to discuss Ankara’s concerns over the bombing of Turkmen villages in northern Syria and called for an immediate end to the Russian military operation close to the Turkish border, according to a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement. “It was stressed that the Russian side’s actions were not a fight against terror, but they bombed civilian Turkmen villages and this could lead to serious consequences,” the statement said. Ankara has long sought the protection of Turkmens, who are of Turkish descent, in Syria.     Updated at 10.24am GMT     10.19am GMT       Shaun Walker in Moscow writes: The big question now, of course, is how Russia will respond?   President Putin is reportedly readying a statement. On Russian state television, there was little discussion of the Turkish claim they had shot the plane down, with anchors and analysts speculating that the Su-24 could have been shot down by rebels with anti-aircraft weapons. This chimes with the Russian Defence Ministry’s claim that the plane was shot down from the ground, but completely contradicts the Turkish statement that an F-16 from its airforce shot the plane down.        10.13am GMT       According to CNNTurk reporting from the border town of Yayladagi, one of the Russian pilots is in the hands of Turkmen opposition fighters, while they are still looking for the second pilot on the ground, writes Constanze Letsch.  Local media also say that Russian helicopters are searching for the two fighter jet pilots, but that Turkmen forces prevent them from landing.  CNN Turk later reported one of the pilots was found dead.  Unverified footage claimed to show the pilots body, according to analyst Eliot Higgins who monitors the conflict in Syria on social media.

Eliot Higgins (@EliotHiggins) November 24, 2015         10.04am GMT       Today’s incident comes just over a month after a Turkish jet shot down a drone that entered its airspace from Syria.  The drone was a similar size and shape to small surveillance craft used by Russia, and military sources in Beirut and the Turkish capital said it is likely that it belonged to the Russian military. But Moscow said all its jets and drones had returned safely to base. Turkey had warned Moscow, after several incursions by fighter jets earlier this month, that it would not tolerate further entries into its airspace. Turkish officials appeared anxious, however, to avoid an escalation on Friday, emphasising that the aircraft was unmanned and refusing to publicly apportion blame. The encounter underscored the febrile atmosphere along the Turkish-Syrian border, where Russia has emerged as a major player in the Syrian war over the past month, boosting the fortunes of Bashar al-Assad and, in doing so, weakening Turkey’s four-year campaign to oust the beleaguered Syrian leader. Turkey’s entire 900km frontier with its southern neighbour is now deeply unstable, with Islamic State again ascendant north of Aleppo, Kurdish groups having used the chaos to advance their ambitions, and Russia having effectively established a no-fly zone above north-west Syria, where many of Ankara’s allies are based.        9.59am GMT       The incident highlights the failure of US and Russia attempts to “deconflict” military conflict over Syria. The US, which is leading an aerial campaign against Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq was not involved in the incident. But after Russia launched its own bombing campaign over Syria, the US pledged to ensure that US and Russian air forces don’t shoot at each other while they conduct overlapping air campaigns over Syria.    Related: 'Deconflict': buzzword to prevent risk of a US-Russian clash over Syria         9.52am GMT       The incident is the first time a Nato member has come to direct blows with Russia over the crisis in Syria, Kareem Shaheen in Beirut and Shaun Walker in Moscow point out.   The area near where the plane was shot down is the site of ongoing clashes between forces loyal to the embattled Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and rebels fighting to overthrow him. Russia launched a military intervention in October aimed at protecting the areas in western Syria still under control by the regime after nearly five years of civil war, and the northern Latakia countryside has seen repeated aerial assaults by both the Russian and Syrian air forces. Shortly after the Russian intervention, Turkey warned the Kremlin that it would not tolerate violations of its airspace, after two incidents that prompted consultations with Nato. Turkey opposes Assad and has condemned the Russian intervention for targeting rebels not affiliated with the terror group Islamic State. The latest incident highlights the grave risks of clashes of arms between the various international forces that have intervened in Syria. A coalition led by the US is conducting an ongoing campaign against Isis in the country, and American and Russian officials have worked on ensuring there are no clashes between their forces as they pursue their separate campaigns. But the shooting down of the Russian plane is an escalation that leaves open the possibility of an open clash between a Nato member state and Russia, whose intervention shows an increasing assertiveness in international affairs.        9.47am GMT    Turkey's version of events    The jet violated Turkish airspace, according to Turkey’s version of events courtesy of the state Anadolu agency”   Turkish jets shot down a warplane believed to be a Russian type SU-24 for violating Turkey’s airspace near its border with Syria on Tuesday, Turkish presidential sources said.  The warplane went down in Syria’s northwestern Turkmen town of Bayirbucak near Turkey’s border within the framework of engagement rules, the sources added. The Turkish General Staff said the downed foreign jet was issued 10 warnings in five minutes and it was shot down by two F-16s. Turkish Armed Forces Chief of General Staff Hulusi Akar briefed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about the situation following the crash. Akar along with Turkish Foreign Minister Feridun Sinirlioglu also briefed Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu.        9.44am GMT    Russia's version of events    Here’s Russia’s Ministry of Defence version of what happen:  Today an aircraft from the Russian air group in the Syrian Arab Republic crashed on the territory of Syria supposedly shot down from the ground. The aircraft was flying at the altitude of 6,000 metres. The status of the Russian pilots is being defined. According to the preliminary data, the pilots managed to eject from the warplane. The circumstances of the crash are being defined. During all the flight time, the aircraft was flying only within the borders of the Syrian territory. That was registered by objective monitoring data.        9.37am GMT       Daily Sabah has footage appearing to show the pilots parachuting before the SU-24 crashed.

Here’s what we know so far:  Russia’s defence ministry says an SU-24 fighter jet has been shot down near Syria’s border with Turkey. Russia’s defence ministry said the plane was over Syrian territory throughout the flight. Turkey said its fighter jets have shot down a warplane after it violated Turkey’s airspace. The jet was warned 10 times in the space of five minutes over airspace, the Turkish military said in a statement. Footage showed a warplane going down in flames in a woodland area, a long plume of smoke trailing behind it.      #SONDAKİKA!Türkmen Dağının yakınına savaş uçağı düştü...Uçağın düşme anını Habertürk TV ekibi görüntüledihttps://t.co/PCUK9Z6RTA Habertürk TV (@HaberturkTV) November 24, 2015     Separate footage from Turkey’s Anadolu Agency showed two pilots parachuting out of the jet before it crashed.
