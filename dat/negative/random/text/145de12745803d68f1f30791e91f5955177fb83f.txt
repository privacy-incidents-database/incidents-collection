Asaf Avidan, Folk-Rock and Pithy Poetry - 

Asaf Avidan, a well-known musician in Israel, writes songs that pull together widely disparate impulses. He often leans toward American-style folk-rock, but he also has a streak of 1960s kitsch and a fondness for electronic loops: His most widely known song is One Day/Reckoning Song (Wankelmut Remix), an EDM-meets-folk concoction.His high voice can be sweetly androgynous but can also rise to a cutting, rasping, bluesy howl. And his lyrics have a pithy poetry, informed by literature, mythology and ballad tradition, akin to Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan: Oh Ariadne, I just need to work this maze inside my head/If only Id have listened to you when you offered me that thread, he sings in The Labyrinth Song from his 2015 album, Gold Shadow. Between tunes, hes a storyteller who easily ambles his way toward big themes.(8 p.m., Sunday, April 10; Monday; Wednesday; and on April 24 at Rough Trade NYC, Brooklyn; roughtradenyc.com.)
