Fashion & Beauty|A Jewelers Ode to His Glamorous Grandparents
These brilliant orbs of hand-cut Jaipuri crystal atop 1920s Japanese pearls, held aloft by delicate talons of diamonds, represent the latest chapter in the designer Hanut Singhs familys obsession with jewels. His great-grandfather, a maharajah famous for his taste in stones, fancied ornate turban pins and ropes of pearls. His grandmother Princess Karam  a celebrated beauty photographed by Cecil Beaton and dressed by Mainbocher  was never without custom pieces made for her by Van Cleef & Arpels and Cartier. Singh, 43, who works between Los Angeles, Mumbai and his native New Delhi, recalls playing in her well-stocked jewelry box as a youngster. Thus inspired, these exquisite earrings, dubbed The Emperors Cap, take the form of his great-grandfathers turbans, while also winkingly referencing the shape of toys  those spinning tops beloved by Indian children.
A brief article on Page 66 this weekend about a pair of earrings by the jeweler Hanut Singh, and his familys influence on his craft, misspells the name of a fashion house whose clothes were worn by Singhs grandmother. It is Mainbocher, not Mainboucher.
