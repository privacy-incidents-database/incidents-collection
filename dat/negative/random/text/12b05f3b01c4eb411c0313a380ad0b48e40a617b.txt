The psychologist John L. Hollands theory of career choice is more than a half-century old, but it remains an essential tool for vocational batteries and career counselors. Personality types and interests are sorted into six categories and matched with suitable careers. A three-letter Holland Code is often used to identify a cluster of strengths, and linked to particular majors for use in counseling. The O*NET job center website, sponsored by the Department of Labor, has a quick test to reveal your Holland profile. Where might you fit in? Consider these Holland-based personality/career matchups.
