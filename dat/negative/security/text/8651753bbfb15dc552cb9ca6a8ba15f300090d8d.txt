New Google Glass App 'NameTag' Gives You A Person's Bio When You Look At Them
Just a few months after Google banned Tits and Glass, an app that let users film point-of-view pornography using their Google Glasses, a new company has developed an app that lets Glass wearers identify strangers just by looking at their face.
The app is called NameTag and uses real-time facial recognition software to match a strangers face to his or her social media profile. Once a match is made, NameTag will display all available information about the person being viewed, including age, marital status, career, and interests.
As if we should all be excited about this, NameTag brags that it "can detect a face using the Google Glass camera, send it wirelessly to a server, compare it to millions of records, and in seconds return a match complete with a name, additional photos and social media profiles."
Kevin Alan Tussy, the apps primary creator, spoke to The Independent about his creation.
"It's not about invading anyone's privacy," NameTag's creator claimed. "It's about connecting people that want to be connected. We will even allow users to have one profile that is seen during business hours and another that is seen in social situations. NameTag can make the big, anonymous world we live in as friendly as a small town."
But is the app really about connecting people who want to be connected?
Rather than asking users to opt-in to allow their information to be used on NameTag, the company automatically uses publicly available information unless people specifically opt out. They assume consent unless explicitly told otherwise. Thats a dangerous precedent to set.
Facial recognition software remains banned on Glass for now. But as Independant writer James Vincent points out, Glasses can be jailbroken -- that is, freed from manufacturer restrictions -- just like a mobile phone.
You don't see many people walking around with Google Glass on yet. With apps like NameTag being developed, that's probably a good thing.
