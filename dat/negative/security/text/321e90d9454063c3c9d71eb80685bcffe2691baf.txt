(ECNS) -- Tens of millions of China Telecom users in China face the risk of personal information leakage over a system loophole, a domestic Internet security monitoring platform has warned.
The platform, butian.360.cn of IT company Qihu 360, said hackers can easily find the loophole in China Telecom's system and get access to private user information, including names, ID numbers, and bank balances.
Replenishing, closing accounts or changing numbers could also be orchestrated through the loophole, it added.
China Telecom, the third largest mobile telecommunication provider in the country, confirmed existence of the loophole on Friday at 10am.
Lin Wei, involved with the platform, said operators may have closed the loophole on the day it was confirmed.
