(KAREN BLEIER / AFP/GETTY IMAGES FILE PHOTO)By Michael LewisBusiness ReporterWed., Jan. 15, 2014Canadas interim privacy commissioner says shes confident Google will force advertisers to respect consumers rights after a probe found the search giants online ad service targeted an individual with health promotions after tracking his activity on the web. Chantal Bernier, named to six-month tenure after the departure of former commissioner Jennifer Stoddart, said Google has already implemented some of the recommendations disclosed on the privacy commissioners website Wednesday and will comply in full by June.

While naming and shaming companies can be effective, at the end of the day they dont have any enforcement powers, said Ryerson University professor and cyber law expert Avner Levin. Ottawa may have been reluctant to toughen privacy laws given Canadians apparent complacency about online privacy threats as suggested in polls, he added.And while the commissioner has the option of taking companies to Federal Court if they refuse to comply with recommendations, Levin noted that the avenue can be long, expensive and risky.The privacy ombudsmans recommendations are in response to a complaint from an individual who after searching online for medical devices to treat apnea, a condition that affects breathing during sleep, was followed by advertisements for the devices as he visited unrelated websites.We also have concerns about whether other advertising networks are complying with Canadian privacy law, Bernier said. We will be contacting various advertising stakeholders in the near future to share these investigation results and remind them of their privacy obligations. While so-called behavioral advertising is not illegal, Canadas privacy laws prohibit advertisers from collecting sensitive personal information, such as individuals health information, for the purpose of delivering tailored ads.Googles own privacy policy says when tailored ads are shown, the company will not associate a cookie or other identifiers with sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation or health.Google says the problem identified during the investigation relates to remarketing campaigns  which allow an advertiser to target ads to recent visitors to their site. Google acknowledged that some of the advertisers using its ad service do not comply with the corporations policy against interest-based advertising relating to sensitive issues. The investigation identified shortcomings in Googles monitoring systems. The Privacy Commissioner recommended Google develop a more formalized and rigorous system for reviewing advertisements for policy compliance. In response to the Privacy Commissioners concerns, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company committed to: Provide additional information to advertisers creating remarketing campaigns; Increase monitoring of remarketing campaigns for possible violations of its policy; Offer more training to its own staff in addressing potential policy violations; and Upgrade its automated review system. Weve worked closely with the office of the privacy commissioner throughout this process and are pleased to be resolving this issue, said a Google Canada spokeswoman in a statement.
