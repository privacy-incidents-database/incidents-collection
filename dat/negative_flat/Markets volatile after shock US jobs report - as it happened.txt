  6.12pm BST    US oil rig count falls again    The number of oil rigs in use in the US has dropped for the seventh week in a row. The latest Baker Hughes survey showed the rig count fell by 5 to 415 last week, its lowest since October 2009.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back on Monday.

Simon Goodley reports:  [Chappell] was forced out of a previous business venture after taking around €400,000 (£315,000) from the company for his personal use. The money, which appears to have been moved without the permission of other shareholders and has never been repaid, was transferred from a start-up company in Spain called Olivia Petroleum, which Chappell fronted and used to bolster his City credentials when he acquired BHS. It is understood that the funds were then diverted into other accounts, including one belonging to Chappell’s wife, as well as being spent at a series of luxury restaurants, hotels and shopping trips, plus a chandlery business that fits out yachts. Chappell is a keen sailor. The allegation about Olivia Petroleum’s finances will raise further questions about the due diligence conducted by the billionaire Sir Philip Green, who sold BHS to Chappell’s consortium Retail Acquisitions for £1 last year and is under mounting pressure to explain his actions. The Serious Fraud Office is also understood to be conducting preliminary inquiries into the activities of Chappell’s Retail Acquisitions consortium leading up to the deal.

The US market’s initial falls were reversed as investors ignored yet another sign that the global economy was not in a particularly good place, and instead concentrated on the prospect that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to raise interest rates in the near future. So after a volatile day’s trading the final scores showed:  The FTSE 100 finished 8.45 points or 0.14% higher at 6125.70, but its 1.85% fall since Monday marks the worst week since mid-February Germany’s Dax has edged up 0.18% to 9869.95 France’s Cac closed 0.42% lower at 4301.24 Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.45% to 17,842.80 Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.15% at 8702.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.69% to 605.61  On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 20 points or 0.11%.       3.39pm BST       Here’s a chart from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing a breakdown of the US jobs:     Breakdown of US jobs Photograph: Bureau of Labor Statistics         3.28pm BST       Markets are finding it difficult to untangle the details of the latest US data, says Marcus Bullus, trading director of MB Capital. He said:  It has been a tale of two reports, as the markets have struggled to reconcile two conflicting indicators – slowing rates of job creation and stronger levels of wage growth. The bears have focused on the disappointing headline number, seeing in it a worrying sign of the US economy’s susceptibility to global headwinds. Yet for the bulls, such concerns are cancelled out by the unexpectedly solid rate of wage rises. Increasing average earnings are often viewed as a reliable barometer of corporate confidence, and the initial rush into fixed income that the report triggered has eased, helping US equities end the week on a more positive note. With the prospect of the Fed hiking rates in June now firmly off the table, the markets are being reassured that the benign interest rate environment won’t be changing any time soon.        3.20pm BST       Oil has edged higher ahead of the latest weekly US rig count, with Brent crude 0.8% higher at $45.37.       3.03pm BST       Here’s our report on the US jobs numbers:   Related: US economy adds just 160,000 jobs in April – further sign of a slowdown         2.57pm BST       More pictures from Greece:     A closed railway station in Athens.

Yannis Koutsomitis (@YanniKouts) May 6, 2016    Earlier came news that consumer confidence in Greece had fallen to a three and a half year low in April.  Not exactly a surprise, given the renewed worries about the bailout programme and the contentious tax and pension reforms.    Updated at 3.12pm BST     2.48pm BST       The jobs data is lukewarm but not unduly concerning, according to analysts at the CEBR:  While some will interpret it negatively, April’s job report represents a lukewarm verdict on the US economy’s current performance. The jobs creation numbers are significantly weaker than expected, but the results on pay growth suggest that the labour market has tightened somewhat. Clearly the pace of hiring has slowed, but this does not necessarily mean a marked cooling of growth in the US, as the details behind the headline number show a more nuanced picture. An economic downturn is typically followed by a long spell of rapid hiring as unemployment or spare capacity in the labour market disappears, a process that is now largely complete. The healthy gains recorded in weekly earnings attest to a market in which workers are beginning to have the upper hand. The participation rate, the unemployment rate, and the number of involuntary unemployed (which all measure spare capacity) have, following sustained improvements during the recovery, changed little since the year’s beginning. In summary, the labour market appears to have stabilised for the time being.... Current indicators show that the services sector expanded in April thanks to a rise in new orders growth. Today’s report demonstrates that the weakness largely pertains to sectors other than services: mining employment fell by 7,000; that in construction and manufacturing showed little change. The sectors making gains were professional and business services, healthcare and financial activities. While a broader sectoral mix would be welcome, this month’s performance shows high-skill services expanding ahead of low-skill occupations such as retail, which made no gains. Consumer confidence, while sagging somewhat at present, should recover assuming wages continue to creep up. There is now little chance of an interest rate hike in June. As it would have been premature in any case, Cebr welcomes this.        2.44pm BST    Wall Street opens sharply lower but quickly recovers    The US market has unsurprisingly got off to a downbeat start after the worse than expected non-farm payroll numbers. But more surprisingly, it is already off its worst levels, and this is helping to revive European markets. The data was well below forecast, adding to the recent reports from around the globe suggesting the world economy is slowing down. But at the same time it seems to have pushed out the expectations for the timing of the next US rate rise, which is providing some support for shares. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now virtually flat having initially fallen around 61 points. The FTSE 100 is now down just 14 points while Germany’s Dax is down 31 points and France’s Cac 48 points, all well off their lows.    Updated at 3.06pm BST     2.37pm BST       Barclays is now expecting just one more US rate rise this year, rather than two, in the wake of the weak jobs data. It is forecasting three rises in 2017.       2.33pm BST       Here are a couple of charts showing the jobs data:     Monthly jobs data Photograph: Bureau of Labor Statistics         2.30pm BST       More reaction to the worse than expected US jobs figures. We could be in for a tricky few months, said David Morrison of Spread.co:  European equities and US stock index futures were already softer ahead of the release but fell further in the immediate aftermath - while the dollar also lost ground. Of course, it’s worth remembering that we’ll have another set of updates on payrolls, manufacturing and services, plus a GDP revision, before the Federal Open Markets Committee meets next month. So we could have a tricky few weeks ahead of us which will be even trickier if Fed members sound off about keeping an open mind on a June hike.  Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, believes a June hike is unlikely now:  The labour market has been a shining beacon compared with other elements of the US economy for the past few months, but no longer. More than 200,000 jobs had been added in five of the previous six months, but today’s figure has come in disappointingly low. An interest rate hike next month is now looking unlikely as the general economic waters are far from calm. Weak growth at home and overseas is a major concern, as is poor manufacturing output, so Janet Yellen and the Fed are expected to keep the interest rate pause button pressed for a little longer.

As an aggregate, the labour report was probably best described as a fairly neutral and crucially, is unlikely to change too many minds on the FOMC about the timing of the next rate hike.  That said, if we were to start seeing a more rapid, sustained downtrend in employment growth over the next few months, this may provide evidence that weakness emanating from the business investment side of the economy, which tends to lead the economic cycle, is starting to filter through to the more lagging labour market – at the moment though, it is hard for either the Fed or ourselves to make any conclusions based on one month’s data.         2.19pm BST       Back in the UK, Thomas Cook has responded to the threat of a half-term walkout by its cabin crew over plans to reduce break times. A spokesperson said:   We would like to reassure our customers that nothing matters more to us than safety. It’s regrettable the union has chosen this path because the crew rest procedure, which includes monitoring all crew rest on all flights, was introduced with the agreement of the union.  It also meets the regulations of industry experts the Civil Aviation Authority and does not compromise on safety. We have offered to meet union representatives and the message we hear directly from our crew is that they’re looking forward to a great summer of flying customers on holiday.        2.13pm BST       The 160,000 non-farm US jobs created in April was way below the average of 232,000 over the last 12 months. Professional and business services created 65,000 jobs in April, higher than the 12-month average. At the other end of the scale, jobs in the mining sector fell by 7,000. Not everyone was surprised by the non-farm payrolls number apparently:    US Non-farm payroll gain exactly in line with Markit PMI signal at 160K. Q1 ave revised down to 200k v Markit 198k https://t.co/HuToiMgahA Chris Williamson (@WilliamsonChris) May 6, 2016         2.03pm BST       Attention will now turn to the Federal Reserve, casting doubt over the central bank’s willingness to raise interests in the face of a softer jobs market. Details of the report from the US Labor Department showed a mixed picture for April. The headline figure of 160,000 was undoubtedly a shocker (202,000 expected), but other elements of the report were in line with expectations.  The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5%, as expected, and average earnings grew by 0.3%, also as expected.       1.57pm BST       US markets are expected to open lower.

This is a large downside shock. Economists were expecting 202,000. The March figure was revised down from an initial estimate of 215,000 jobs. Reaction to follow.    Updated at 1.33pm BST     1.22pm BST       Almost time for US payrolls. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting the report to show that non-farm payrolls increased by 202,000 in April, lower than March’s 215,00. Just under 10 minutes to go.       1.20pm BST    Thomas Cook in May half-term strike threat        Thomas Cook cabin crew are voting on possible strike action during the half-term holiday in May. The dispute centres on proposed changes to the length of breaks staff will be allowed to take. Cabin crew will be allowed one 20-minute break over a 12-hour shift, according to Unite, Britain’s largest union. More than 1,000 cabin crew have begun voting in a ballot for industrial action.  The union said staff were previously entitled to a 20-minute break every six hours and that the proposed changes would put passenger safety at risk.

Days after claiming the title for the first time in the club’s history, visitors are planning to descend on the city in droves this weekend according to Trivago, the hotel search website. Searches for a hotel stay in Leicester for the coming weekend jumped 277% since the win (compared with the week before). The average stay required was one night. Leicester will receive the trophy after their final home game of the season against Everton on Saturday.  A hotel room in the city on Saturday night will cost you an average £128, up 49% from the May monthly average of £86. Room availability for this Saturday is just 4%. In a sign that heightened interest is not limited to this weekend alone, hotel searches for all future travel to Leicester increased by 195%.  Trivago’s Denise Bartlett:  With much buzz surrounding Leicester’s inconceivable Premier League victory, it is unsurprising to see a last-minute surge in hotel searches to the city.  The average stay duration of one night suggests that fans have either managed to obtain last-minute tickets, or simply want to soak up the atmosphere and celebrate.  The increase in travel interest for a hotel stay in the future, however, suggests that Leicester’s tourism industry may be able to experience more long-term benefits from the media exposure.”        12.04pm BST         Athens Airport announcement for general strike #Greece #generalstrike pic.twitter.com/DhSd6kpPgk Derek Gatopoulos (@dgatopoulos) May 6, 2016      Second protest today due to 48h #strike in #Greece against planned social security reform#apergia pic.twitter.com/KTc6dWG2uJ Savvas Karmaniolas (@savvaskarma) May 6, 2016         12.02pm BST    Greece strikes over pension and tax reforms       A protester in Athens.    Tensions are already running high in Athens as Greeks take to the streets at the beginning of a three-day general strike. A strike was already planned for Sunday, to coincide with a parliamentary vote on tax and pension reforms, but unions called on Thursday for the strike to be extended to Friday and Saturday. The austerity measures are part of a package reforms that are being proposed in return for more bailout money from Greece’s lenders. Workers from the Greek shipping industry, civil service, and public transport sector are among those taking part in the strike. Greece’s largest labour union, the private sector GSEE, said the proposed reforms were the “last nail in the coffin” for workers and pensioners who have already suffered six years of austerity. A GSEE spokesperson said:   They are trying to prove to the Eurogroup that they are good students but the y are destroying Greece’s social security system.        11.24am BST    IMF urges eurozone to start Greek debt relief talks        Christine Lagarde is losing patience with eurozone finance ministers. The head of the International Monetary Fund has written to all 19 of them urging them to immediately start talks on providing debt relief for Greece, or risk losing the support of the IMF for a Greek package. In the letter - seen by the FT’s Peter Spiegel - Lagarde writes:   We believe that specific [economic reform] measures, debt restructuring, and financing must now be discussed contemporaneously. For us to support Greece with a new IMF arrangement, it is essential that the financing and debt relief from Greece’s European partners are based on fiscal targets that are realistic because they are supported by credible measures to reach them.  Lagarde issued the warning as talks between Greece and its eurozone partners on a package of reforms appear to have stalled. Last month, finance ministers told Athens they wanted to see €3bn (£2.4bn) of specific contingency reforms in place - as an insurance policy in the event that main reform measures did not go far enough to allow Greece to make its repayments - before releasing more funds. But no agreement has been reached on contingencies, and the IMF wants debt relief to be included in the talks immediately.

Industrial production rose 1.2% in March, rebounding from a 0.3% drop in February and the best performance since 2014.  It was much better than expected - economists had forecast a smaller 0.3% increase.

A modest dip in private sector car sales may well be the consequence of consumers becoming more wary about buying big ticket items due to increased concerns over the economic outlook and a recent dilution of purchasing power compared to the peak levels of 2015. Over the longer term, much will obviously depend on how earnings growth develops, given that employers have been using prolonged negligible inflation as a reason to award modest pay increases. Also important is whether the labour market can regain momentum after the EU referendum.         9.40am BST       The best-selling cars in the UK in April:           9.36am BST    UK new car sales rise 2% in April        New car sales rose again in April, up 2% compared with a year earlier. A total of 189,505 new cars were sold last month - the largest number for the month of April in 13 years according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The increase was driven by fleet and business sales, up 6.1% and 2.8% respectively. Sales to individuals however fell 2.5%. It followed a very strong March, when 518,000 new cars were registered, making it the second-biggest month on record. April’s numbers take the total number of new cars sold in 2016 so far to 961,285, 4.4% ahead of this time last year. Mike Hawes, SMMT’s chief executive, reiterated his point that greater-than-usual uncertainty lies ahead for the car market in the months ahead, as the UK goes to the polls on EU membership. After such a strong March, April’s steadier performance was to be anticipated, and is in line with our expectations for the year.   Consumer confidence remains high as buyers continue to capitalise on attractive finance deals, although this could be affected by political and economic uncertainty in the coming months.      Car sales in the month of April         8.56am BST    BHS row: Green calls for MP to step down from inquiry        Sir Philip Green, the billionaire former owner of BHS, has called for the resignation of MP Frank Field as head of the parliamentary investigation into the retailer’s demise. The entrepreneur has accused Field of being “prejudiced” against him. Green sold BHS for £1 a year ago to a group of little-known investors. Last week the retail chain collapsed into administration putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving the company with a £571m pensions black hole. As chairman of the work and pensions committee, Field is leading the parliamentary inquiry (due to begin on Monday) into what went wrong at BHS.      MP Frank Field    Field told the Financial Times on Thursday that Green should “make good” the pension scheme by paying off the deficit, or lose his knighthood:   I feel that Philip Green has a moral duty to make good the pension scheme and if he doesn’t, while I can’t speak for the committee as a whole, I personally would recommend he should lose his knighthood. Sir Philip is a master of bullying but he will find that parliament isn’t for being bullied.      Sir Philip Green    Green described the comments as an “outrageous outburst” and called for Field to step down:   Clearly he has made his decision as to what he feels the punishment should be without even hearing any evidence from anybody about BHS or the circumstances of the last 15 years. I think Mr Field needs to stand down from the inquiry immediately as he is clearly prejudiced.  Read our full story on the row here.       8.23am BST       Investors are particularly nervous about the US payrolls report today following other worrying signals that the labour market is weakening in the world’s largest economy. A study published on Thursday showed the number of US workers laid off last month jumped, hitting the highest level for an April in seven years. Meanwhile the US Labor Department said the number of Americans making new claims for unemployment benefits rose 17,000 to 274,000 last week - the largest increase since February last year. Economists had forecast a smaller number of around 260,000.       8.11am BST       Oil prices are also falling this morning. Brent crude oil is down 0.5% at $44.77 a barrel.        8.09am BST    European markets open lower    The cautious sentiment has spread to Europe, with markets opening lower across the board this morning. The FTSE 100 is down 0.7% at 6,076. Germany’s DAX is down 0.5%, the French CAC is down 0.7%.

Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management”  Recent global economic data and some corporate earnings from major Western firms have been lackluster, leading to risk-off trading in markets.  Japan’s Nikkei Index fell 0.25%. In China, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 2.2%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 1.2%.       7.39am BST    Markets await US payrolls report    Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The big news item on the agenda today is the US payrolls report for April, published at 13.30 UK time. Economists and investors are nervous about this one. The headline non-farm payrolls figure is expected to show 202,000 jobs were created in April, fewer than the 215,000 created in March. A softer US jobs market would only add to fears of a wider slowdown, and investors are fearful that the number today could be even lower, as Michael Hewson from CMC Markets explains:  Expectations around today’s number are for 200k new jobs to be added for April, down from 215k in March, which would be more in line with the better than expected ISM non-manufacturing report which came out on Wednesday. That saw a decent rise in the employment component, with the unemployment rate remaining steady at 5%, but there does appear to be an undercurrent of concern that suggests we could see a miss to the downside.   European markets are on course to end the week down for a second week, as concerns persists over the state of the global economy.
