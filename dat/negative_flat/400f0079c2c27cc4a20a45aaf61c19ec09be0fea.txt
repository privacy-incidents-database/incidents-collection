Orchestras From San Francisco and Baltimore Come to Carnegie
Marin Alsop will lead the New York premiere of the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Kevin Putss The City.
It is a challenging time for classical music, with orchestras under pressure to shake things up. But two American conductors have been innovators for years, and both are leading their orchestras at Carnegie Hall.Michael Tilson Thomas, music director of San Francisco Symphony since 1995, conducts two programs (8 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday, April 13-14). The first offers three Copland works, including the flinty Orchestral Variations and the seldom-heard 1926 Piano Concerto (with Inon Barnatan), and Schumanns Second Symphony. The next night, Mr. Thomas conducts Schuberts Unfinished Symphony and Mahlers symphonic song cycle Das Lied von der Erde.Marin Alsop, who has invigorated the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra since becoming music director in 2007, leads the New York premiere of the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Kevin Putss The City, a tone poem, and Mahlers Fifth Symphony. (8 p.m., Saturday, April 16; 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org.)
