CURRENTS: SECURITY; Perfect Welcome for a Burglar: Siren, Camera and a Call to Police
The SafeScout security system by Sentinel Vision, of Palo Alto, Calif., is compact enough for an apartment. It has a monitor, above left; a siren, center; and a remote control, right. The monitor plugs into an outlet and a phone line. Within seconds of sensing movement, it sets off the siren and sends pictures and an audio recording to Sentinel Vision, which can notify the police. The owner gets a phone call or an e-mail message with pictures; if there's no burglar, he can stop the siren, let the police know and reactivate the system, the company says. The system, with a monthly subscription fee of about $20, is $200 at target.com or (800) 591-3869.
