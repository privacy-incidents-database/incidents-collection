  8.47pm BST    Summary      Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there! Donald J.

This is not a default,” Walker pealed in his ringing endorsement. “Ted Cruz is in the best position by far to win the nomination of the Republican party.”  Trump berates Walker for not raising taxes     Walker.

Campaigning like Brooklynites    The Democratic candidates turned to Wisconsin and New York, where an aide to Hillary Clinton said her rival, Bernie Sanders, will “campaign like a Brooklynite, and she’s going to campaign like a senator”. Is ‘campaign like a Brooklynite’ an insult?     Sanders. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock      Updated at 10.02pm BST     8.46pm BST    Clinton courts black voters      Hillary Clinton in Milwaukee.

Barack Obama blames the media for enabling Trump    “There was a price if you said one thing and then did something completely different,” Obama told reporters on Monday night. “The question is, in the current media environment, is that still true?” John Kerry: elections ‘embarrass’ US     Obama.

Scalia’s absence resonates in ruling    Updated at 10.02pm BST     8.45pm BST    Summary    But cracks in Republican opposition to a successor are starting to show: three senators have called for hearings, and more than a dozen have said they’ll meet the nominee.
