Election 2015  live: Miliband urges voters in Scotland not to "gamble" on the SNP

  9.23pm BST       We have an interview with Ed Miliband in tomorrow’s Guardian and available to read online here. Speaking ahead of the closest election in a generation, the Labour leader attacks David Cameron for being reduced to arguing that “the key question facing the country is a battle of resources between London and Scotland”.       9.11pm BST    Evening summary    This time next week we’ll know what the results of the general election are, and, if today’s to-ing and fro-ing is anything to go by, it’s not going to be smooth sailing. After last night’s ask the leaders edition of BBC Question Time, party leaders battled it out to see who dismiss the other quicker while simultaneously trying to present themselves as the only viable option for Britain. Here’s everything that happened today. The big picture     Ed Milliband speaks at an election rally in Glasgow. Photograph: Paul Hackett/Reuters    Ed Miliband spoke at a rally in Glasgow tonight, where he urged voters not to “gamble” on the SNP and insisted his opposition to doing a post-election deal with Nicola Sturgeon’s party is a matter of principle. He said Labour could not “do a deal with a party that wants to break up the UK when we want to build it up”. He also refused to accept Nicola Sturgeon’s claim that Labour’s failure to work with the SNP would result in David Cameron winning a second term as prime minister, and said the only thing the SNP wants is another independence referendum.  If we set England against Scotland, if we set any part of our country against another, it does not help working people, it harms working people. It undermines the ability to share resources. It drives down wages and conditions in the race to the bottom. Nationalism doesn’t understand we are stronger, not weaker, when we look after each other across the whole of our country. Nationalism never built a school. It never lifted people out of poverty. It never created a welfare state that healed the sick and protected our most vulnerable. Nationalism cannot create the jobs we need.  It was an impassioned and rising speech from Miliband in a region where Labour is on course to be completely wiped out. Whether it will be enough to win back some support from the nationalists is unclear – only time will tell. Either way, Scotland is looking like the key battleground in this final week of election campaigning. What happened today  Ed Miliband announced Labour would effectively cancel the bedroom tax on its first day in office. It would do that by making funds available to councils to allow them to compensate people for the cost of the bedroom tax in full.   David Cameron accidentally said the election would be a “career-defining” one instead of a country-defining one during a speech at Asda headquarters in Leeds. He also failed to rule out a cut in child benefits during the course of the next parliament.   Nicola Sturgeon said Ed Miliband’s comments last night ruling out a deal with the SNP, even if that costs him his chance of forming a government, will be “disastrous” for Labour in Scotland.   Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems would only go into coalition with a party who will invest an extra £8bn a year on the NHS and will introduce maximum waiting times for mental health services.   Nigel Farage said he would “absolutely not” help Labour form a government, and also ruled out a formal coalition with the Tories and the Lib Dems, saying he would rather “drive the agenda” rather than accept a ministerial car.   Latest polling by Lord Ashcroft in marginal constituencies revealed that Tory voters might just save Jim Murphy - who is now only 3 points behind the SNP in East Renfrewshire - and that the Conservatives have completely reversed Labour’s previous four-point lead in Croydon Central.   The Green Party launched its LGBTIQ Manifesto, which contained pledges to: review the discriminatory blood ban, introduce LGBTIQ-inclusive sex education, protect LGBTIQ asylum seekers, improve services for trans people, and promote LGBTIQ rights abroad.

That’s it from me today. Join me again tomorrow morning for the first day of the final weekend of the general election campaign, as I bring you all the news, reaction, fall-out, pictures and sometimes even, jokes from the trail. I think it’s safe to say it’s not going to be a relaxing weekend for politicians. Or for us, who continue to keep a watchful eye on them.

We have 60 in five key seats giving their view throughout the campaign as part of our polling project with BritainThinks. They each have an app and are telling us what they think of stories as they crop up. Below are some of their thoughts, from party political tattoos to potential back room coalition deals:          8.47pm BST       Occupy Democracy protesters have gathered in London’s Parliament Square in a bid to concentrate the minds of voters ahead of polling day, and plan to remain there if there is a hung parliament.

Organiser George Barda said the protesters hope to stay in the heart of Westminster beyond election day, as there may be some: “political horse trading” if there is a minority government, and said that they hope to show that people of various interests need to be represented in politics. Mr Barda added:   We have come out in to Parliament Square which is a symbolic and iconic location for democracy in the world, supposedly, [and] seems like a sensible thing to do when there is so much spin being told to people.

Updated at 8.48pm BST     8.30pm BST       The former Labour first minister Jack McConnell has said that Miliband will struggle to form a government if Labour is not the biggest party. Lord McConnell told BBC Newsnight that if David Cameron wins more seats, even without a majority, “the public perception will be that he has won” and “anyone who tries to get around that, to get a deal to get a different PM, will be in trouble.”  Even if Cameron was to lose a few seats, if he still has a few seats more than Labour then public perception will be that he has won. Therefore the SNP argument that everybody else could gang up on him will not work. If we get to Friday morning and the sitting prime minister who is in Number 10 has won more seats than anyone else he will automatically get the first go and the public will expect him to do that.     Updated at 8.30pm BST     8.26pm BST       Nicola Sturgeon has said the SNP would vote down a Labour budget if it imposed cuts.

The party’s deputy leader Stewart Hosie emphasised the SNP’s platform to promote progressive policies.  Mr Miliband sacrificed any claim to progressive politics on Thursday night, when he indicated that he would prefer to let the Tories back in to continue their cuts and damage to society for five more years, rather than work with the SNP to keep them out. That represents a further abandonment of principle by Labour. The SNP have a platform to promote progressive policies for the benefit of Scotland and the whole UK at this election - including an end to the cuts, new investment in our NHS, and a minimum wage of £8.70 by 2020. It is clear that electing a big group of SNP MPs next Thursday is the way to lock the Tories out of Downing Street, and achieve the decisive position needed to deliver these progressive policies.        8.19pm BST       More data on the BBC Question Time debate The most searched leaders on Google during the debate:  David Cameron: 27.7% Ed Miliband: 53.7% Nick Clegg: 18.6% Here are the top questions for each:  Cameron:  What does David Cameron say about austerity?

Photograph: Paul Hackett/Reuters    Miliband gave a powerful and rising speech in Glasgow. He urged Scottish voters to remember their grandfathers and parents who worked hard and fought for Labour in the past. Citing “great” Labour leaders throughout history, Miliband seemed confident and managed to get through his speech without any notes and without stumbling once. Angry nationalist protests outside the venue might even have worked to his benefit, as he warned of the dangers of separatism and billed his party as the party of social justice across the whole of the UK. Here are the key points from his speech:  Miliband told voters not to “gamble” on the SNP and insisted his opposition to doing a post-election deal with Nicola Sturgeon’s party is a matter of principle. He said his party could not “do a deal with a party that wants to break up the UK when we want to build it up”.   I know the people of Scotland want a more just society. And with food banks, payday lenders and the neglect of the NHS, Scottish people feel there must be no delay. That’s why I have a clear message for the people of Scotland today: don’t gamble with the SNP when you can guarantee change with Labour. I am also clear there will be no deal, no pact, no coalition, no tie-in with the SNP. I don’t say that for tactical reasons - I’m advocating this for principled reasons. We cannot do a deal with a party that wants to break up the UK when we want to build it up.   Miliband refused to accept Nicola Sturgeon’s claim that Labour’s failure to work with the SNP would result in David Cameron winning a second term as prime minister. He said it was the SNP winning seats from Labour that would increase the Tories’ chances of being the largest party.    I will never put the Tories into government. I have spent my entire political career fighting them. But the tragedy is that the SNP may very well might let the Tories in. That’s what could happen if the Tories are the largest party.   Miliband said the only thing the SNP wants is a second independence referendum. “That’s their priority. That’s their promise. But it is not ours. Our priority is social justice,” he said.   Miliband said Labour believes in the principles of sharing and solidarity that underpin the partnerships of four nations that is the modern UK. He added:   If we set England against Scotland, if we set any part of our country against another, it does not help working people, it harms working people. It undermines the ability to share resources. It drives down wages and conditions in the race to the bottom. Nationalism doesn’t understand we are stronger, not weaker, when we look after each other across the whole of our country.  Nationalism never built a school. It never lifted people out of poverty. It never created a welfare state that healed the sick and protected our most vulnerable. Nationalism cannot create the jobs we need.   Miliband also spoke about Labour’s plans for a future government, including devolving more powers to the Scottish parliament, banning zero-hours contracts, giving regulators the power to cut energy prices, introducing a 50p tax rate, taxing bankers’ bonuses, abolishing non-doms and the bedroom tax.   Under my government, those with the broadest shoulders will bear the greatest burden. And in the country I lead, there’ll be no hiding place for the hedge funds, the tax havens who shield the tax avoiders, the Tory party donors who think tax avoiders is something everybody does.  That is what the pooling and sharing and resources means. That is what solidarity and social justice is all about.     Updated at 8.51pm BST     7.57pm BST       Miliband says he wants to devolve more powers to Scottish parliament, to make it one of the most powerful and devolved in the world. He talks about zero-hours contracts and big energy companies. “I’m going to do the right thing for working people, we’re going to give the regulator the power to cut prices this winter.” He adds Labour will introduce 50p tax rate. “Under my government, those with the broadest shoulders will bear the greatest burden. And in the country I lead, there’ll be no hiding place for the hedge funds, the tax havens who shield the tax avoiders, the Tory party donors who think tax avoiders is something everybody does. We will abolish non-dom status.” He says Labour will tax the bankers’ bonuses and use those resources to put young people back to work. “That is what the pooling and sharing and resources means. That is what solidarity and social justice is all about.” Miliband says he wants to go further. “We want to abolish the bedroom tax. The indefensible and cruel tax, that tells you everything you need to know about a Tory government. We will legislate straight away to abolish the bedroom tax.”    Updated at 7.57pm BST     7.52pm BST       There’s only one thing the SNP want and thats independence, Miliband. “If you want social justice, not separatism, vote for a Labour government.”       7.51pm BST       More from Miliband:  If we set England against Scotland, it does not help working people, it harms working people. It undermines the ability to share resources. Nationalism doesn’t understand we are stronger, not weaker when we look after each other across the whole of the country. Nationalism never built schools or lifted people out of poverty. It cannot create the jobs we need.        7.49pm BST       Miliband tells voters not to “gamble with the SNP” and says there will be “no deal or coalition” with them. He says this stance is for “principled reasons not tactical reasons.”       7.48pm BST       Miliband says Cameron has not ruled out cuts in child benefit, he’s not even pretending like last time. “We have 6 days to save your child benefit. I’ll protect tax credits. I’ll protect child benefit. Vote Labour to put your country first.”        7.46pm BST       Ed Miliband says he’s got a simple message. “People have the opportunity to be part of change. This is one of the most important elections our country has ever seen. The differences couldn’t be clearer between my vision and David Cameron’s. It’s about a different idea about how a country succeeds.” He says wealth does not trickle down, Cameron’s vision fails the people of Scotland and Britain. “We know the damage that five years of a Tory government has done”.

After days of weasel words and prevarication David Cameron is still failing to rule out cutting child benefit and tax credits again. All he has said again is he won’t abolish child benefit, but he won’t deny he plans to cut it or take it away from millions of families. Everyone knows it’s impossible for the Tories to achieve their £12 billion of cuts to social security without hitting family budgets hard. Child benefit and tax credits are now on the ballot paper next week. While Labour will protect them, the whole country now knows the Tories will cut them again.        6.55pm BST       While hundreds of Nicola Sturgeons spring up in London as she tours Scotland by helicopter, David Cameron goes to Asda, and Jim Murphy shows his strength in Paisley – here’s our election photo highlights of the day:   Related: Election photo highlights: The leaders are out in force as campaigning continues around the country      Updated at 7.27pm BST     6.48pm BST       Nigel Farage has accused Ed Miliband of turning his back on the British public by saying the country cannot have a referendum on European Union membership.

Dave had just confirmed out loud the very reason why so many voters find him hard to trust. He isn’t in the job primarily to make the country better and heal north-south divided: he is what everyone most fears and dislikes. A career politician. A man, who apart from a few year’s working as a PR man for a TV station, has known no life outside the Westminster bubble. A man who quite possibly understands the concerns of ordinary people even less than those other career politicians, Ed and Nick.

Lib Dem campaign spokesperson Lord Scriven blamed Labour for the social housing crisis and said Miliband needs to be honest with voters.  Under Ed Miliband’s watch social housing fell by 421,000 - the lowest level since the 1960s - and it was a Labour government that introduced the so-called ‘Bedroom Tax’ in the private sector.  Only the Liberal Democrats have the solutions for sensible reform to the Spare Room Subsidy, so that more families have access to suitable properties, while ensuring no-one is forced out of their home unfairly. Yesterday Ed Miliband refused to say that Labour overspent in government. Today he refuses to accept responsibility for the social housing crisis he left.  It is time he was honest with voters. Only the Liberal Democrats will build a stronger economy and a fairer society, creating opportunity for all.        5.27pm BST    Survation poll: Labour 1pt ahead    The latest Survation poll puts Labour one point ahead of the Conservatives.

Now here’s something creative sent to us via guardian witness, based on the photos of the leaders – who are all in their 40s – from today’s Guardian front page.           Dave and Nick looking older according to Microsoft age guessing app   Try for yourself. http:\\http://how-old.net/        Sent via GuardianWitness    By  mspatey   1 May 2015, 14:40       According to Microsoft’s new facial analysis tool How Old Do I Look, it seems as though the last five years may have taken it’s toll on the coalition partners: with David Cameron to appear looking 53 years-old and Nick Clegg 59 years-old, on the age-guessing app. While the state-of-the-art cloud-based algorithm estimates Ed Miliband looking like he’s 31 years-old.       5.19pm BST       The polls have been in deadlock since the middle of March with Labour and the Conservatives both hovering around 33.5%. But that is no longer the case – the Tories are now ahead.   poll   While figures this week have ranged from a Conservative six-point lead to a Labour three-point advantage, it is not the size of a lead that is so important, but the relative vote share of the two parties within individual polls. Here the trend is both clear and consistent across the polls: support for the Tories during the campaign has ranged on average from 32.5 to 35.5% compared with Labour’s 32 to 34.5% – and the Conservatives are now polling closer to the top of their range. Over the past two weeks, David Cameron’s party has opened up a two-point lead in the Guardian’s average of polls. The Tories ended the week on around 34.5%, two points ahead of Labour. However, while these percentages would probably make the Conservatives the largest party due to the losses Labour is expected to make in Scotland, this wouldn’t automatically mean that Cameron stays in Downing Street. As things stand, the arithmetic is to the advantage of Miliband. This is because the sum of the “anti-Tory” bloc – those parties that have said they would vote a Tory government down – currently adds up to 329 seats: a majority. While tallying up all the possible sources of support for a Cameron-led government yields 315 votes. In order to have the numbers he needs to stay in government, the PM needs his party to win about 290 seats, and for Labour to drop to 260. The differences from here to there may seem small, and if the Tories’ current two-point lead turns into four or five points in the next five days, Cameron may well find he has done enough to cling on. However, under the bonnet of the two blocs, the mechanics that could propel one to Number 10 are more complicated for Cameron than they are for Miliband.

I’ve wittled down the key points for you:  Miliband says the housing crisis is the single biggest issue facing Londoners and fixing it will be one of his top priorities as prime minister.   Our aim is to build 200,000 homes a year by 2020 and help local authorities give priority to first-time buyers. We’ll help renters by introducing new three-year tenancies which will limit rent rises, and we’ll ban letting agencies from charging tenants letting fees. We have to do something about foreign investors who keep properties empty just to watch the value increase. Councils will be able to charge double the council tax if flats are left vacant for more than a year, and off-plan sales will have to be offered in Britain first, not overseas.   Miliband says he will have a Cycle Safety Assessment for all new road schemes in London as well as restoring national targets to cut deaths and serious injuries. “We will introduce tough new rules for HGVs, which have been involved in three deaths already this year,” he says.   Miliband says he will make it easier to see a GP, so people aren’t forced to go to AE.   Currently one in four people wait a week or more to see a GP. We will guarantee GP appointments within 48 hours, or on the same day if you need it. Our Time to Care Fund will create 8,000 more GPs, who will help deliver this guarantee.  Another key thing is to ensure that older people can get the care they need at home – many vital care services have been stripped back over the last 5 years.  Our plans to improve GP access will help ease the pressure on hospital wards. So will our guarantee of a maximum one-week wait for cancer tests, which will include more testing in GP surgeries and community clinics.   Miliband says he would have more police on the beat to battle gangs.   Under David Cameron there are 4,000 fewer uniformed officers on London’s streets, whereas I’ve committed a Labour Government to protecting 10,000 police jobs across the UK. It’s a scandal that the Metropolitan Police Force is still so unrepresentative of London’s diversity. We will place a requirement on all police forces to actively recruit more black and ethnic minority officers.   Miliband says he will deliver a national framework so local authorities can encourage cleaner vehicles and will support proposals for the Ultra Low Emission Zone to be opened up to the whole of London.   He says will set targets to ensure more women are represented at boardroom level and set up a review into the ethnic diversity in top jobs. “And we will take action to make our police, judiciary and civil servants more representative of London’s diversity.”        4.51pm BST       The Green Party has launched its LGBTIQ Manifesto. The manifesto contains pledges to:       Review the discriminatory blood ban Introduce LGBTIQ-inclusive sex education Protect LGBTIQ asylum seekers Improve services for trans people Promote LGBTIQ rights abroad  Natalie Bennett launched the manifesto in Soho earlier today alongside LGBT campaigner Peter Tatchell.

It’s good, but it’s still not on Francois Hollande levels.       4.12pm BST    Ashcroft poll: Jim Murphy narrows gap on SNP    Ashcroft’s latest polls come as mixed news for the parties, as he writes in his analysis (below). What’s most interesting is that Tory voters might just save Jim Murphy, who is now 3 points behind the SNP.  Perhaps the most striking of these is in Croydon Central, where in a poll completed yesterday I found a four-point Conservative lead over Labour. This compares to a four-point Labour lead in March, and a six-point Labour lead last October. The UKIP share in the seat has nearly halved, from 19 per cent to 10 per cent, since the October poll. There is also better news for Esther McVey in Wirral West, where Labour’s lead is down from five to three points since last month. This small narrowing of the gap comes as both main parties have increased their vote share, again at the expense of UKIP. I found Labour two points ahead of the Tories in Norwich North, only a very slight change from the one-point Labour lead recorded in the seat in February. In Pudsey, where two previous polls have been tied, neither party has broken the deadlock – the one-point Tory lead leaves the seat still too close to call. In this round I also polled three new seats at what must be the bottom end of Labour’s target list to see if any surprises could be in store. I found the Conservatives two points ahead in Margot James’s Stourbridge seat, and a comfortable 12-point Tory lead in Battersea. But Labour were leading by two points in Peterborough, where Stewart Jackson is defending a majority of 4,861. I looked again at North Cornwall, where I twice found ties last year, followed by a two-point lead for the incumbent Lib Dems last month. The margin remains the same this time, leaving the race very close indeed.      Jim Murphy poses for a portrait while visiting a car dealership in Paisley, Scotland.  Photograph: Alan Dodd/Demotix/Corbis     In East Renfrewshire, Jim Murphy has narrowed the gap from nine points to three since my previous poll earlier this month. This seems largely down to Conservative voters – the Tory share is down five points, and Labour’s up five, since my last survey, and remaining Conservatives are less likely to rule out moving to Labour than in most seats. Nearly a quarter of those who voted Conservative in the constituency in 2010 now say they plan to vote for Jim Murphy. Unfortunately for the Tories, Labour voters seem unwilling to return the favour in Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale, where the SNP have extended their lead from two points to eleven. Only 7 per cent of 2010 Labour voters have switched to the Tories, and 82 per cent of current Labour supporters rule out doing so. Taken together, the results show that there can be late movement on the battleground as the election approaches and voters’ minds are concentrated, and there is still room for more in the final week. That is why even these polls remain snapshots, not predictions.

Messina Quantitive Research (MQR), the company of former Barack Obama aide Jim Messina that is calling voters in marginal constituencies, can do as much polling as it wants without the costs going towards the political parties’ spending limits, according to the Electoral Commission – unless the party has specifically discussed or ordered the poll. This is regardless of whether or not the results are shared privately with a party. One voter claims he was told that he would receive further calls until he answered all their questions. Fed up of PPI calls? Imagine this.        3.54pm BST       Here’s something for the music fans out there – Noel Gallagher has said he won’t be voting for Ed Miliband because “he’s a fucking communist”. In an appearance on Channel 4’s Alan Carr Chatty Man tonight, the former oasis man says he will not be taking part in the election because none of the parties appeal to him.   I’m not sure I can get behind any of them at the minute. I dunno. The fact that Cameron didn’t turn up for the debate is a disgrace. I think that Miliband, if he gets in, is just going to fail us.  Carr replies: “Give him a bloody chance. Look at his little face, how can you say that?” To which Gallagher says:  Because he is a fucking communist.  The musician continues by dismissing Nicola Sturgeon as well:  The other unpleasant little woman from over the border. Cheap shoes... and then there’s the Greens - whatever. And the other mob [presumably Ukip]...  Carr then asks Gallagher if he has fallen out of love with Tony Blair, after visiting the then-Prime Minister at Downing Street with Creation Records boss Alan McGee in the late ‘90s.  Not really. Happy days. Happy days for us all. The ‘90s were great and that first period of New Labour, as they called it, was great. They kind of lucked out a bit because when they got in the internet exploded, so the economy exploded. When politicians get in, nothing really changes. If no one voted, and I’m not saying that no one should vote, but if nobody voted and you wake up the next day and no one gets voted in, we’re still going to go to work in the morning. Life’s not going to end. But I’m not going to vote this time because I missed my postal vote and I’m going to America in the morning. I would have voted for the most ludicrous thing – the monster raving loony party or something.        3.51pm BST       Hello, I’m taking over from Andrew now.

Updated at 3.51pm BST     3.45pm BST       Catherine Shuttleworth, the businesswoman who strongly criticised Ed Miliband on Question Time last night, has called me back. She rejects the suggestion that she is a Conservative supporter who was admitted as a member of the audience on false pretences as an “undecided” voter (see 11.25am), or that she was some form of Tory plant (social media, passim). She said that she has never been a member of any political party and that, although she did sign the pro-Conservative letter from small business owners, that was because she agreed with the sentiments in it, not because she agreed with the party on everything. She did set up a business with Andrew Jones, who is now a Conservative MP, but she said that was because they had worked together 15 years ago and that he was not involved in politics when she set the business up. She said that she did give George Osborne a thumbs up in the spin room after the debate, but that she had never met him before in her life and that she only responded like that because he congratulated her on her question and called her “a fiesty woman”. She was particularly dismissive of the suggestion that she was put up to confronting Miliband by the Tories.  I’m a strong-minded Yorkshire woman. No one tells me what to do.  She applied because she was watching Question Time last week and they said it was coming to Leeds and invited people to apply. She said she lives in the Leeds North West constituency (where the Lib Dem Greg Mulholland is defending her seat) and that she was someone whose voting record was “mixed”. When she applied she told the BBC, correctly, that she was undecided about who she would support, she told me, and even now she is still undecided, she said. Although the Telegraph said she was leaning towards the Conservatives, she said that was not necessarily correct.   The one person who changed my mind a bit was Nick Clegg. I thought he came across quite well.  That’s all from me for Today.

Those who view her more favourably (38%) outnumber those who view her less favourably (26%) by 12 points. On the same basis, Ed Miliband has beaten David Cameron. Miliband’s net rating is +4, while Cameron’s is -8. But the real loser is Nigel Farage. His net score is -18, meaning that far more people view him unfavourably than favourably.

Of Camerons career defining slip, Miliband says Hes finally found something he is passionate about, his own career Sam Lister  (@sam_lister_) May 1, 2015         2.06pm BST    Guardian backs Labour    The Guardian is backing Labour. Here is our endorsement editorial. And here is an extract.  Mr Miliband has grown in this campaign. He may not have stardust or TV-ready charisma, but those are qualities that can be overvalued. He has resilience and, above all, a strong sense of what is just. Mr Miliband understood early one of the central questions of the age: inequality. While most Tories shrug at that yawning gap between rich and poor, Labour will at least strive to slow and even reverse the three-decade march towards an obscenely unequal society. It is Labour that speaks with more urgency than its rivals on social justice, standing up to predatory capitalism, on investment for growth, on reforming and strengthening the public realm, Britain’s place in Europe and international development – and which has a record in government that it can be more proud of than it sometimes lets on. In each area, Labour could go further and be bolder. But the contrast between them and the Conservatives is sharp. While Labour would repeal the bedroom tax, the Tories are set on those £12bn of cuts to social security, cuts that will have a concrete and painful impact on real lives. Even if they don’t affect you, they will affect your disabled neighbour, reliant on a vital service that suddenly gets slashed, or the woman down the street, already working an exhausting double shift and still not able to feed her children without the help of benefits that are about to be squeezed yet further. For those people, and for many others, a Labour government can make a very big difference. This newspaper has never been a cheerleader for the Labour party. We are not now. But our view is clear. Labour provides the best hope for starting to tackle the turbulent issues facing us. On 7 May, as this country makes a profound decision about its future, we hope Britain turns to Labour.  The leader also says that it would be good to have some Lib Dems and Greens in the Commons and that, where the real choice is between Lib Dems or Conservatives, we would support the Lib Dems.       1.53pm BST       Nicola Sturgeon says the SNP is in favour of PR for Westminster. They have it in Edinburgh, she says, and the SNP would vote for PR for Westminster elections too.        1.52pm BST       A well-organised faction is already making plans to impose its demands on the prime minister on the day after the election. No, it’s not the SNP. It’s the executive of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee. According to Isabel Hardman at Coffee House, it has scheduled a meeting for a week today, at 4pm.  The powerful executive of the 1922 Committee will meet that afternoon in order to prepare their demands for the Prime Minister and discuss any initial outlines of a coalition agreement between the Tories and the Lib Dems that have already been passed on to them. They will be preparing for a meeting of the full party on Monday, where they will set out their demands in full.        1.45pm BST       Sturgeon says she does not claim to speak for the whole of the Scottish nation.       1.44pm BST       Q: Would you be willing to bring down a minority Labour government? Sturgeon says she is not going to Westminster to bring down governments. But, with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, there would be scope for changing Labour policies.       1.41pm BST    Nicola Sturgeon on Election Call    Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, on Radio 4’s Election Call now.

Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images    A group of Tory activists wearing SNP T-shirts and sporting Nicola Sturgeon face-masks appeared in Victoria Tower Gardens, in the shadow of the Palace of Westminster, to highlight the “fearsome 50” SNP MPs who could hold the balance of power.  Michael Gove, the Scottish-born Conservative chief whip who accompanied what the Tories call the “shoals of Sturgeons”, said that Labour could be held to ransom by the SNP. Gove declined to photographed next to the “shoals”. But he did take questions from the media. Here are the highlights  Q: Why are you focusing on the SNP and not on Ed Miliband’s claim in the Question Time debate that Labour did not spend too much money in government? Gove: Oh no. I have. I have been up since 6am this morning doing a series of interviews. One of the points that I made is that people would have found the bare-faced audacity of that comment unbelievable. The audience certainly did. They couldn’t believe he would be willing to defend the tax and spending record of the last Labour government.  If Ed Miliband is in Downing Street the only way he can make it is on the back of SNP votes. That means we are going to have a lethal cocktail of more taxation, more spending and more borrowing. Ed Miliband, far to the left as he already is, will be pushed further to the left by the fearsome 50 SNP MPs who are pledged vote by vote and day by day to hold him to ransom.  Q: Would an SNP MP elected in Glasgow be as legitimate as a Conservative MP elected in Surrey? Gove: Yes. I did not say it [a Labour government supported by the SNP] would be illegitimate. I did say it would be deeply harmful to this country.   Q: What do you think of the prime minister’s claim that this is a career defining election? Gove:: It is a defining election for the whole country. The careers that matter are the careers of the 2m people who’ve got jobs now who didn’t have jobs before as a result of us.  Q: Is a big bloc of SNP MPs the equivalent of the Irish Nationalists in the late 19th century which obviously changed the habits of GB politicians? Gove: I am fascinated by history and Alex Salmond has compared himself to Charles Stewart Parnell [the nineteenth century Irish Nationalist leader]. But I think what we have now is actually an unprecedented situation because you would have a weak leftwing prime minister held hostage every day. You can have up to 14 votes a day in the House of Commons. There have been 1,000 votes in the last five years. If, before every single one of those votes, Ed Miliband has to secure the support of the SNP, go cap in hand to Nicola Sturgeon and to Alex Salmond and to their fearsome 50 that means we will have a paralysed government which will result in more taxation, more spending and more borrowing for all of us.  Q: Ed Miliband was clear in the Question Time debate: there will be no deals with the SNP. Gove: He was clear that he wouldn’t have the SNP in a coalition and he wouldn’t have a confidence and supply arrangement. But the SNP aren’t offering that and aren’t talking about that. The SNP are talking about supporting him vote by vote, day by day. That is precisely the danger we are pointing out today - that rather than their being one deal there will be daily deals between the SNP and the Labour party if we don’t have a majority Conservative government.

Patrick OFlynn (@oflynnmep) May 1, 2015         1.27pm BST       Earlier this week Margaret Hodge, the Labour chair of the Commons public accounts committee, was accused of tax avoidance hypocrisy because of the way she has benefited from some family shares. Speaking on Radio 5 Live, Hodge insisted that she had had absolutely nothing to do with the shares being sheltered offshore. She said she paid full tax on the shares when she inherited them, and she criticised her relatives for sheltering them in Liechtenstein, a tax haven.  What happened here was I am a Jewish immigrant, my family came from Germany and Austria, during the war dispersed all over the world. An uncle in America and an aunt in France established a trust. I had absolutely nothing to do with establishing a trust. I didn’t control it and I didn’t run it.  I didn’t benefit from it at all when it was offshore. I inherited the shares when they came onshore and I have always paid tax to the full.  This was all a legacy, an inheritance from my refugee Jewish family.  I only inherited the shares when they were brought onshore and I paid tax on it. Am I critical of my relatives? Yes, I don’t think she should have done what they have done. I understand why they did it, they were refugees. All I can say is this was a trust established by not even people who were British citizens. They set it up, they controlled it, they ran it. Only when the shares were in the UK did I inherit them.  Have I paid full tax - full tax - since they have been here? I have, honestly I have. I can’t see what else you could have expected me to do.        1.17pm BST       I’m not sure who produced this, but it’s fun, and it could help Ed Miliband’s optimism ratings (see 12.31pm) a bit.                 1.05pm BST          Jim Murphy, the leader of the Scottish Labour Party, poses for a photograph under a car during a visit to a Honda dealership in Paisley, Scotland.

David Cameron pointedly avoided ruling out cuts or other changes to child benefit on Friday, two days after the Liberal Democrats leaked a document detailing how such plans were proposed in 2012 ... While Cameron spoke emphatically, his language was equivocal. Speaking at Asda headquarters in Leeds on Friday morning, Cameron was again asked if he could be more explicit and rule out a cut in child benefit, but again did not make this promise. “With child benefit we’ve made our reform,” he said. “We’ve said it is a vital benefit for Britain’s families. It goes straight to the mother in most cases. It forms a key part of family budget. We’ve made our reform. We’ve frozen it in this parliament and said we’ve said we’ll have to freeze it for two years in the next parliament. We’ve said child benefit stays because it’s so important.  “But should we be reforming welfare? Should we have a country where it always pays to work? Yes we should.”        12.48pm BST       Here is today’s Guardian three-minute election video.

In a reader QA with PinkNews, Natalie Bennett, the Green party leader, was asked about her stance on polyamory rights - whether people in three-way relationships should be allowed civil partnership or marriage. This is not a topic that has so far consumed a great deal of attention during the election, but Bennett, to her credit, gave a full answer. She would think about it, she said. Here is the QA in full.  Q: At present those in a ‘trio’ (a three­way relationship) are denied marriage equality, and as a result face a considerable amount of legal discrimination.  As someone living with his two boyfriends in a stable long­term relationship, I would like to know what your stance is on polyamory rights. Is there room for Green support on group civil partnerships?  Bennett: At present, we do not have a policy on civil partnerships involving more than two people. We are, uniquely in this country, a party whose policies are developed and voted for by our members. We have led the way on many issues related to the liberalisation of legal status in adult consenting relationships, and we are open to further conversation and consultation.

Ed Miliband’s disastrous revelation that he would rather let the Tories back in than work with the SNP to keep them out will galvanise even more people to vote SNP. Already, more than half a million people who voted Labour at the last general election are journeying to voting SNP next Thursday. Ed Miliband has allowed his campaign to be dictated and pushed around by the Tories south of the border - and Labour will pay a heavy price in Scotland. His extraordinary remarks make it even more important that Scotland unites to elect a big group of MPs to give Scotland a decisive position at Westminster and lock the Tories out.

However, if you look at the possible alliances, the “anti-Tory” bloc - those parties that would vote a Cameron government down - still hold a lead - albeit a small one - and the Conservatives are projected to lose 38 seats to Labour. Cameron needs to roughly cut this deficit by a third. Simply put, the Tories need to open up an even greater lead over Labour in the final days of the campaign. It is also worth keeping in mind that most of Labour’s lost ground over the past month is driven by Scotland - and any seat Labour loses to the SNP makes no difference to the overall arithmetic. And there is a ceiling to the number of seats Labour can lose in Scotland and Miliband’s party has pretty much hit it - things (in Scotland) can only get better on 7 May.

Photograph: Ian Driver    My colleague Rob Evans has discovered that police have been monitoring the political activities of a Green party candidate standing against Nigel Farage in South Thanet.  Official documents show that police have been monitoring Ian Driver’s political activities since at least June 2011, recording his appearances at public meetings and demonstrations. One of the entries notes that Driver is a “Green Party councillor and parliamentary candidate for Thanet South”. The records on Driver, 49, have been stored in a secretive database set up by police to track campaigners deemed to be “domestic extremists”. The publication of the records comes as there are mounting questions over the police’s monitoring of elected politicians. Driver said the monitoring of his “entirely lawful protest” was “highly inappropriate”, as the police knew that he was a parliamentary candidate and a councillor. He added that it “could impact on my rights as candidate in an election to speak openly and frankly on policy matters”. Driver, who has no criminal record, was selected in January last year by the Green Party to contest Thanet South. That month, police logged that he was one of thepeople at a protest outside a Margate hotel where Farage was addressing his supporters.  You can read the full story here.
