Like the first instalment of Hotel Transylvania in 2012, this sequel about a retreat for famous monsters has triumphed despite weak reviews. This time around, Dracula (Adam Sandler) is concerned that his half-human grandson Dennis may not have vampire abilities, and mounts a clumsy plan to try to draw out the boy’s powers. (The original film also broke the record for a September opening and went on to make $358m total worldwide.) The Intern also performed well this weekend, despite negative publicity after De Niro walked out of an interview with Radio Times journalist Emma Brockes. The film, directed Nancy Meyers and starring the double Oscar winner as a septuagenarian intern at an e-commerce company, debuted at second place with $18.2m. It co-stars Anne Hathaway.

Disaster flick Everest opened in wide release at fourth place with $13m. It had opened last week on Imax and larger-format screens in a pioneering limited release bow that brought in $7.5m. The top five was rounded out by the Oscar-tipped, Johnny Depp-led mob biopic Black Mass, which made $11.5, for a second-week total of $42.6m. Two other new films landed on the top 10 this week: Eli Roth’s low-budget horror picture The Green Inferno was ninth with $3.49m, thanks to a release strategy that targeted cinemas popular with fans of genre films; and Denis Villeneuve’s Tex-Mex border thriller Sicario was 10th, earning an impressive $1.77m from just 53 cinemas on limited release. Villeneuve’s film, which centres on a hunt for an anonymous drug lord and stars Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin, is expected to move to a full release next weekend. There was less positive news for Roland Emmerich’s drama Stonewall, which has received scathing reviews. The film, about the 1969 riots at Greenwich Village’s Stonewall Inn which helped spark the gay rights protest movement, made just $112,414 from 129 cinemas on limited release. Its per theatre average was therefore just $871, compared to $30,000 for Sicario.         Watch the trailer for Hotel Transylvania 2 – video    North American box office 25-28 September 1.
