The US supreme court has granted a stay of execution for a Texas death row inmate, just over two hours before he was scheduled to die. Cleve Foster, a 47-year-old former Army recruiter, was convicted of the rape and murder of a young woman in 2002. He was due to be put to death by lethal injection around 6pm local time in Texas. It is the third time his execution has been stayed shortly before he was due to die. In their brief order, the judges gave no reason why they granted the stay and said Fosters execution will be delayed while it considers his appeal.  Foster was one of two men convicted and sent to death row for fatally shooting a 30-year-old woman whose body was found in a ditch by pipeline workers in Fort Worth in February 2002.
