The handgun that Federal authorities said Lynette Alice Fromme pointed at President Ford yesterday was a Colt .45caliber semiautomatic pistol, according to United States Attorney Dwayne Keyes in Sacramento. Calif.He said there was no bullet in the firing chamber, but there were four in the magazine, or clip, that fits into the grip.This type of pistol has been the standard United States military handgun since 1926, and was produced by the millions before and during World War II.Firing a heavy, relatively slowmoving bullet, it gained a reputation as a devastating weapon at close range.It is prepared for firing in two ways. In one, the loaded magazine, which holds seven cartridges, is inserted into the grip and then the pistol's slide is pulled back and released forward. This carries a cartridge into the firing chamber and also cocks the pistol, making it ready to fire.In the other method the slide is locked back by means of a catch, the magazine is inserted and the slide is released, again taking a cartridge into the chamber.
Either way the pistol cannot be fired until the slide is activated, although the hammer can be drawn back and cocked independently of the slide.
