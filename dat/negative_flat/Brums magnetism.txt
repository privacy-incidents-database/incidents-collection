The magnetic levitation railway technology, which David Hurry says has been proven in Japan and China (Letters, 31 October) was pioneered at Birmingham airport, coincidentally on the HS2 route.Dr Ian WestTelford, Shropshire • Any party that will renationalise the railways, energy companies and water will have the greatest win in any election ever. Just have the courage.Elizabeth BakhurstBarnet, Hertfordhire • Our trick or treaters included a girl in a cloak and pointed hat, one in a brown animal costume, and a small boy wearing a Tony Blair mask: the lion, the witch and the warmonger.Dave HeadeyFaringdon, Oxfordshire • Can I nominate Jane Wade (Letters, 30 October) for a Guardian award for best letter? The beautifully written description of her encounter with a destitute young man on her way to a concert, so tellingly and imaginatively compared with another young man, the concert pianist, conveyed the utter depravity of aspects of this governments social security programme with truly poetic concentration and insight. Please send copies to all coalition cabinet members, their aides and abetters.Keith HearndenLoughborough, Leicestershire • My parents, in 1944, both said love, honour and equal pay during their wedding (Letters, 30 October). I am still waiting for equal pay for all women.Mari BookerBrighton • Here on the edge of the Peak District (Letters, 31 October), Ive just made six pots of own-brand crabapple jelly, harvested a basketful of fine yellow quinces, and picked a suppers worth of pot-grown courgettes and the final four fat figs (the last of at least 20). Well, this is Yorkshire.Kirsten Cubitt ThorleySheffield • We have heads of purple sprouting broccoli and primroses in flower. Theyre both either six months early or six months late. Ive no idea which.Peter HansonExeter
