Google has updated its maps feature, introducing the option to get multi-stage directions, find upcoming events at local venues, and view flight, hotel, and restaurant reservations. The update affects Googles Maps Preview on desktop, which allows users to choose to upgrade to an early version of the companys next major release of its maps product. Driving, walking and cycling directions can now have multiple destinations. Clicking a plus sign lets users search for new locations and add them to the bottom of the list. They can then be rearranged by clicking and dragging, with up to 10 locations visited in order. Public transport directions, however, are still limited to one start point and one end point.

Finally, when a user signed in to their Google account searches for an airport, hotel or restaurant which they have a reservation at, the site will now show that reservation alongside the venue. The feature requires Google to accurately recognise which incoming emails are reservations, so it can be fooled. • Google Earth, combined with app-controlled drones, are helping save the life of elephants in Kenyas game reserve.
