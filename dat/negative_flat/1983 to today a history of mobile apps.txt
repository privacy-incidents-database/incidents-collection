1983 to today: a history of mobile apps

The old photos show a young man, white shirt rolled at the sleeves and wearing a small bow tie, waving his arms excitedly as he gave a conference speech in Aspen in the summer of 1983. This was Steve Jobs, six months away from launching the first Macintosh. Twenty-four years before the first iPhone; 27 years before the first iPad. That day in Aspen, Jobs predicted the evolution of a new digital distribution system. It would be a little like a record store, he said, where software would be downloaded over phone lines. Jobs saw apps and app stores coming. Apps emerged from early PDAs, through the addictively simple game Snake on the Nokia 6110 phone, to the first 500 apps in the Apple App Store when it made its debut in July 2008.

To view on mobile, you will need to download the Prezi app.   Matthew Panzarino, co-editor of TechCrunch, has charted three phases of app development that took mobile technology from telephony to gaming and utilities, to apps that wanted to be your “home screen” and dominate your experience, to apps armed with content that “are more about maximizing their usefulness without dominating your attention.” So what comes next? The volume of content produced is going to lead us towards managing our apps in a different way. The most persuasive concept is the idea of the “card” – a design treatment you can already see on Twitter and Facebook across different devices – and which allows content to be aggregated and presented to the user in a consistent way. Secondly, mobile is moving out of the pocket and becoming wearable. With the growth of wearable tech, the need for intelligent aggregation of content will fuel app innovation. One possible future is that apps as we know them will eventually cease to exist at all – being replaced by brand names and services that give you actionable insights throughout the day. Imagine a customised newsfeed full of the services you use – presented at the right time. Think of how Google Now might evolve, for example. Thirdly, the idea of multiscreen will become “every-screen”. App developers won’t design for desktop and mobile any more. They will design a single experience that will stretch across any internet connected terminal. That brings us back to the concept of cards and how content presented in this way could work well for users on almost any type of screen and be meaningful. So the future of the app may be no future at all as we move to an era of seamless connectivity and experience wherever we are and whatever device we use.
