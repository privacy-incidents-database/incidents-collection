Judge John Hodgman on Opening Numerous Bottles of Wine
Andrea writes: My husband insists on opening numerous bottles of wine at one time. I think you should finish one bottle before you open another because it doesnt taste as good after its been open for a couple of days.I should recuse myself, because I really would like to attend one of your husbands multiday dinner parties. But, though it may risk my invitation, I must side with you. You can open two bottles of wine. That way you can drink one while the other one is open to the air, which apparently does something good to wine according to wine people (I dont know for sure because Im tired of listening to them). But opening three or more bottles of wine all at once makes it look as if youre having some sort of weird, middle-aged frat party. Or an orgy, maybe? If its an orgy, please invite me, and I will bring my own gin and creepy mask.
