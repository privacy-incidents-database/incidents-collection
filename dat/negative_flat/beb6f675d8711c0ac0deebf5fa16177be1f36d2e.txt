Chicago has sent many theatrical gifts to New York over the years, including Tracy Lettss August: Osage County and some great plays by the Chicago native David Mamet (in general, if not lately). A notable import of the moment is Ike Holters Exit Strategy, in previews in a Primary Stages production. Mr. Holter, named Chicagoan of the Year in Theater by The Chicago Tribune in 2014, received a rave from Chris Jones of The Tribune when Exit Strategy ran there. Mr. Jones described the play, about the final days of a failing urban high school, as at once poetic, political, sad, funny, timely, complex and compassionate and went on to compare the linguistic excitement with Mr. Mamets feisty early work. (Opens Tuesday, April 12, Cherry Lane Theater; primarystages.org.)
