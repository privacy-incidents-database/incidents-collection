Pope Francis       Pope Francis did a lot of remarkable yet simple things to make people think about peace. He is a reformer of people’s minds towards non-violence, acceptance and love, yet he is modest. I also think a Nobel peace prize for a pope from Argentina is something that the country and the entire Latin American continent could be proud about, inspiring the people who live there.  Denis Mukewege       Related: From Pope Francis to Angela Merkel: the top contenders for the 2015 Nobel ?peace ?prize     He has a long record of assisting rape victims in the most risky and hostile environments, under threats. His dedication and passion are boundless and his contribution and support to a vulnerable group is invisible, as is his on-going fight for gender equality.  Mariam Mehdi   Dr Mukwege is doing work in an area that makes most of us so terribly uncomfortable that we refuse to acknowledge its existence – the horrific crime of rape being used as a military weapon. Perhaps if his work were known to the wider world it would bring more international awareness.   Patricia Hall John Kerry and Mohammad Javad Zarif       Over two years of intensive diplomacy the two men crafted a deal on Iran’s nuclear programme. They overcame the enormous technical complexity of the issue. It was a victory for tenacious diplomacy.  Frey Michel Victor Ochen  There are so many people in northern Uganda who have benefited from the efforts of Ochen and AYINET. Besides, he has become an inspirational icon for many young Ugandan and African leaders. Indeed, his win could mean much more for the youth all over the world regardless of race and other social classifications.   Oenen Martin   His story is inspiring, it gives a ray of hope to innocent people who are in war zones. He choose not to pick a gun but he choose peace. I feel he deserves it. It will be the first time the people of northern Uganda will say at least there’s something good coming from here, not Kony.  Steve R Namanya  Angela Merkel       Merkel’s diplomatic skill, tenacity and sheer hard work in the Ukraine crisis and the negotiation of the Minsk Treaty merit this international recognition. She has emerged at a critical time as one of very few western politicians able to conduct meaningful dialogue with Putin. Were she honoured in Stockholm, it would also be a generous and welcome boost to the morale of all those struggling manfully to honour Frau Merkel’s confident ‘Yes, we can’ by coping practically with the asylum seekers billeted daily on their towns and villages.   britwatch             Lucy Wood    07 October 2015 10:16pm  Merkel, Brave woman. The other candidates involved in immigration only wanted to keep the peace with the locals and move people on. Merkel invited people to STAY.      Mussie Zerai       His deeds are beyond explanation. He has been rescuing refugees for over a decade. It’s so difficult to get over 100 distressed calls a day for such a long period.  Merhawi Yacob   Refugees are stripped of their humanity and their sense of honour. They have become the target of unscrupulous governments and other groups becoming rich on refugees’ pain and lives. Priest Mussie deserve the Nobel prize and beyond for his courage, love for humanity and love for refugees from all over the world. I hope he will not be overlooked.   Kiki Tzeggai  Here are some alternative nominees suggested by our readers: Clive Stafford-Smith        Clive Stafford-Smith is the British attorney who has represented 128 Guantánamo inmates. This includes the final British prisoner in Guantánamo, Shaker Aamer, who has been held since 2002 and thanks to the work of Stafford-Smith, is set to be released shortly. Since 2004 Stafford-Smith has also been the legal director of Reprieve, an international human rights charity campaigning against the death penalty, the use of drones of war and the use of torture. In his career representing death penalty defendants, he has unfortunately lost six cases. However he was won 294, ensuring that not only the lives of the accused but also their families and communities have received fairer justice.  Will Hutton Daisaku Ikeda   Daisaku Ikeda has been an advocate for world peace since the age of 19. This octogenarian has garnered countless honorary doctorates since 1975. Every year Dr Ikeda has written a United Nations peace proposal to end nuclear weapons. Ikeda has established chapters of the SGI (Value Creation Society) in over 192 countries and has globally united SGI members to strive for world peace in our lifetime. His humility for the dignity of each person is admirably equitable for those from the lowest station to the highest. Dr Ikeda has chosen world peace as his lifelong quest making him the most deserving person for the Nobel peace prize.   Francine Adams  Médecins Sans Frontières         Their heroic work during the Ebola crisis was critical in every sense, far better even than WHO. And MSF brings such determined, dedicated, sophisticated work to so many places around the world.   Michael West  Edward Snowden       His actions started a worldwide debate about basic freedoms and rights in the digital age, which western societies have failed to address properly since the internet has become ubiquitous. He also exposed far-reaching and unprecedented abuse of surveillance capabilities by state and non-state actors in an age of anti-terror activities. The debates he has ignited centre on central questions about the erosion of civil liberties to protect supposed security, the cost of peace and the balance to be struck. All crucial elements in promoting peace.   Alex Fowles  Dawn Engle and Ivan Suvanjieff   Dawn and Evan are the founders of Peacejam, an international organisation dedicated to educating young people and engaging them on social issues, working hand in hand with Nobel laureates such as the Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, Jody Williams, Shirin Ebadi and others. They have made the shortlist in the past but I believe it’s time the world recognised their dedication and hard work to make the world a peaceful place.   Bennett Nugba Abdul Sattar Edhi         He has setup the not-for-profit organisation Edhi Ambulance service. It serves in major Pakistani cities but its main setup of business is in Karachi. Despite turbulent times, his service to his nation is a prime example of promoting peace in society by sharing peoples grievances.   Abdul Ahad
