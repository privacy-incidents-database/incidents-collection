Tech firms urge Obama to 'move aggressively' on NSA reform – live

  11.00pm GMT       Were going to wrap up our live blog coverage for the day. Read out latest news story here.       9.16pm GMT       Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee chair, returns to the Leon ruling. She says there are two valid views as to the constitutionality of some NSA surveillance programs and now there can be a debate. It was not a debate she has left much - any - room for in the past. She has lectured many colleagues and witnesses about the scrupulous legality of NSA spying.  I welcome a Supreme Court review, Feinstein says.  Its been more than 30 years. We didnt have terrorism when Smith v Maryland was put forward - that was 1979 - and we didnt have cell phones.... I think most people believe, well now a federal court judge has declared the program unconstitutional, where there are differing opinions now, thats the state of play. The assumption is that its going to be appealed, and the Supreme Court is going to make a decision [and thats as it should be].   Feinstein says it is crucial for the committee to have access to Office of the Legal Counsel memos in order to carry out oversight. Unless we know the administration basis for sanctioning a program, its very hard to oversee it, Feinstein says:  We have to know what regulations, what rules, what laws enable a president to move and say yes, do this. And if we dont see it, its very hard to exercise oversight. And an administration may not want that--but thats the purpose of our being. [... You are going to encounter some heat from us in that regard. Most of us have been here a very long time and we know that we need this information.         9.10pm GMT       Krass and Senator Carl Levin extend the back-and-forth over what legal documents intelligence agencies mus show Congress, their supposed overseers. Not much, Krass thinks:    I do not think so, as a general matter, that Senate intel committee has the right to legal memos re intelligence, says next CIA top lawyer Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) December 17, 2013         8.54pm GMT       The debate in the UK over government spying with Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, former GCHQ chief Sir David Omand and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, meanwhile, has concluded. Paul Owen summarized the debate here just moments ago. Heres the top line:  Sir David Omand, the former head of GCHQ, claimed that mass surveillance was not being undertaken by the intelligence agencies in the UK and US - instead bulk access was what spy services had, a very different thing. The crowd at parliaments committee room six seemed sceptical about this distinction, which Omand did not fully explain. Omand said bulk access was necessary to stop terrorists and international criminals. Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia said the choice was not between bulk access or the criminals and terrorists running wild - instead certain private communications could be accessed on a proper legal basis.  Read the full summary here.        8.48pm GMT       Guardian national security editor Spencer Ackerman flags a moment in the ongoing Senate intelligence committee hearing on the nominations of Daniel Bennett Smith to be assistant secretary of state for intelligence  research, and Caroline Dianne Krass to be general counsel of the CIA. Legislators questioned the nominees about their commitment to sharing intelligence documents with Congress. From the committees perspective, document sharing is crucial to oversight. Smith has just said it is his understanding that the state department shares all its documents with the committee. It would certainly be my commitment if I am confirmed to maintain such document sharing, Smith says.  But thats not the understanding of Sen Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, who says the committee did not get documents from the state department – and specifically from intelligence  research, which Smith is nominated to run – relating to the 2012 Benghazi attack.  Krass, for her part, declined earlier to commit to providing such documents – and in fact went further:    @attackerman She went further than that. Said she wouldnt give it. Exempted ALL as predecisional. emptywheel (@emptywheel) December 17, 2013      Updated at 8.49pm GMT     7.39pm GMT       The chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Dianne Feinstein, has been a staunch supporter of the NSA. But that support wavered in the light of revelations that the agency had spied on the cellphone of German chancellor Angela Merkel. And today, she introduced another note of qualification. A day after a federal judge tore into the NSAs bulk collection of telephone metadata, Feinstein said the tool was not “indispensable” for preventing terrorism. In an interview with MSNBC Feinstein urged the Supreme Court to determine its constitutionality.  I’m not saying it’s indispensable. But I’m saying it is important, and it is a major tool in ferreting out a potential terrorist attack.        6.52pm GMT    Tech firms urge Obama to 'move aggressively' on NSA reform    The tech companies meeting at the White House has wrapped, and the participants have issued a one-line joint statement.  We appreciated the opportunity to share directly with the president our principles on government surveillance that we released last week and we urge him to move aggressively on reform.  When the White House announced this meeting on Monday, it said the purpose was to discuss progress made in addressing performance and capacity issues with HealthCare.Gov and how government can better deliver IT to maximize innovation, efficiency and customer service. It said it would also address national security issues and discussions about the economy. No mention of the troubled healthcare website in that statement. Quite the opposite: executives at the tech companies briefed the Guardian ahead of the meeting that they were not exactly enamoured by the White Houses attempt to portray the meeting as a wide-ranging chit-chat about general priorities.  There’s only one subject that people really want to discuss right now,” one executive told our reporter, Dominic Rushe.       5.26pm GMT       Tonight Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian editor, Sir David Omand, the former head of GCHQ, Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia and others will debate the extent of UK surveillance in parliament. Paul Owen will be live-blogging it over here from 6pm GMT (1pm EST).       5.09pm GMT       NSA surveillance and the judge Leon ruling get the Taiwanese animators treatment. Some viewers found it to be more informative than 60 Minutes piece.     @attackerman better than 60 Minutes Eric Knutson (@GambitRF) December 17, 2013         4.46pm GMT       There was no sign of the technology company CEOs going into their 10.45am meeting with president Obama, reports Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts (@RobertsDan). The executives are meeting with Obama to discuss possible reforms to US government surveillance practices. The tech companies – Google, Yahoo, Apple, Comcast, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Netflix – have reacted angrily to revelations that NSA has intercepted data flowing between company hubs overseas and domestically.       4.34pm GMT       Guardian Washington correspondent Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) has filed a profile of Larry Klayman, the activist lawyer who is the plaintiff in the suit against NSA that produced judge Leons ruling.    He once sued his own mother. The anti-Obama Tea Party activist and serial litigator behind the NSA lawsuit: http://t.co/PZdIrCPXtq Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) December 17, 2013    From the piece:  His penchant for lawsuits has seen him take on targets as varied as Hugo Chávez, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Dick Cheney, Barack Obama, Mark Zuckerberg and, in a lesser-known case, his own mother.  He is often referred to as a “gadfly”, which is probably an understatement for a former Justice Department prosecutor who switched sides before filing at least 18 suits against the Clinton administration in the 1990s. He was once barred from a California courtroom for, among other impertinences, making further argumentation when he had been ordered by the court to cease speaking. Characteristically, Klayman appealed.        4.10pm GMT       Late last week, the contents of a new report by a presidential team tasked with recommending reforms to NSA began to leak to the media. The report to the president has not been released, but it is said to contain three basic recommendations: 1) shrink some bulk collection 2) spin off the job of head of Cyber Command from the NSA director job, and 3) add a public advocate to the FISA court.  Even before the reports release, the White House rejected outright recommendation No. 2 – making the NSA director job separate from the Cyber Command job and giving it to a civilian. On Friday, national security council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden announced the White House had decided the position would not be split. National security journalist Marcy Wheeler, writing in the Guardian, says the process looked toothless from the start:   Two things are at issue with this jockeying. First, all the evidence about this review group suggested it was a typical Washington DC whitewash. Rather than appointing outsiders, as Obama had promised, the group members – made up of Cass Sunstein, Geoffrey Stone, Peter Swire, Richard Clarke, and led by former acting CIA director Michael Morrell – have close ties to the president and/or the national security community. And the group reported through director of national intelligence James Clapper, whose performance should have been reviewed. No pure technical experts were included on a panel that ought to be assessing technical alternatives. [...] Nevertheless, as soon as it did recommend changes, the White House moved quickly to shut down any discussion of that main recommendation. [...]  Read the full piece here. And follow @emptywheel on Twitter:    Karl Rove. Just the guy I want to hear talk about Judge Leons decision.https://t.co/v0yedBq1W4 emptywheel (@emptywheel) December 17, 2013      Updated at 4.14pm GMT     3.54pm GMT       This afternoon Senator Dianne Feinstein, who has continuously insisted on the strict legality of all NSA surveillance and the strength of Congressional oversight of that surveillance, will convene an intelligence committee hearing likely to host some mention, if not discussion, of judge Leons ruling, which subverts everything Feinstein has been saying for months. The hearing will consider the nominations of Daniel Bennett Smith to be assistant secretary of State for intelligence  research, and Caroline Dianne Krass to be general counsel of the CIA. The reason Leon is likely to come up is that sitting on the committee is one of the most staunch privacy advocates in Congress, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. In a statement released yesterday, Wyden said Leon hit the nail on the head:  Judge Leon’s ruling hits the nail on the head. It makes clear that bulk phone records collection is intrusive digital surveillance and not simply inoffensive data collection as some have said. The court noted that this metadata can be used for ‘repetitive, surreptitious surveillance of a citizen’s private goings on,’ that creates a mosaic of personal information and is likely unconstitutional. This ruling dismisses the use of an outdated Supreme Court decision affecting rotary phones as a defense for the technologically advanced collection of millions of Americans’ records. It clearly underscores the need to adopt meaningful surveillance reforms that prohibit the bulk collection of Americans’ records.  Wyden goes on to notice the judges expression of ‘serious doubts about the efficacy of the program.’ Read Wydens full statement here.        3.38pm GMT       If you havent yet read judge Richard Leons scathing ruling declaring the mass collection of phone metadata to be an indiscriminate and arbitrary invasion of privacy, its here, in a version helpfully annotated by Guardian national security editor Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman).  The ruling argues that a 1979 Supreme Court decision often cited as precedent for metadata collection, Smith v. Maryland, actually is irrelevant. The judge thus contradicts 1,001 lectures by pro-surveillance legislators such as intelligence committee chairs Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Mike Rogers about the supposed Smith precedent:  Indeed, the question in this case can more properly be styled as follows: When do present-day evolutions in the Governments surveillance capabilities, citizens phone habits, and the relationship between the NSA and telecom companies- become so thoroughly unlike those considered by the Supreme Court thirty-four years ago that a precedent like Smith simply does not apply? The answer, unfortunately for the Government, is now.   Judge Leons ruling drops just as the NSA was ramping up a public relations push, with Sundays loving 60 Minutes piece and a reportedly clumsy visit-NSA-day for journalists. Bad timing.    Man, did Judge Leon just step all over the NSAs big public-relations push... Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) December 16, 2013         2.48pm GMT       Senior executives from some the world’s largest technology firms are meeting face-to-face with Barack Obama today to press their case for a major rollback of National Security Agency surveillance, Paul Lewis reports from Washington.  Many of the senior tech leaders meeting the president and vice-president, Joe Biden, have already made public their demand for sweeping surveillance reforms in an open letter that specifically called for a ban on the kind of bulk data collection that the judge ruled on Monday was probably unlawful. Judge Richard Leon’s ruling, which will now be subject to an appeal, is the most significant legal setback for the agency since the publication of the first surveillance disclosures by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, and it comes at a pivotal moment for the future of the NSA. The president and his advisers are currently considering the recommendations of an NSA review panel set up in the wake of Snowden’s revelations ... The review panel, which handed its findings to Obama on Friday, has reportedly proposed only limited reforms, saying the NSA’s surveillance tools should be amended in light of Snowden’s disclosures but essentially remain intact ... Among those meeting at the White House are Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, Marissa Mayer, the CEO of Yahoo, and Eric Schmidt, Google’s executive chairman. Senior representatives from Comcast, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Netflix will also be in attendance. So too will Randall Stephenson, the chairman and CEO of ATT, one of the telecom providers routinely required to provide the NSA with so-called metadata about its US customers.     Updated at 3.22pm GMT     1.05pm GMT       Tonight Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian editor, Sir David Omand, the former head of GCHQ, Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia and others will debate the extent of UK surveillance in parliament. Here is the full line-up (more details here): • Alan Rusbridger, editor-in-chief of the Guardian • Sir David Omand, former director of GCHQ • George Howarth MP, Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, which oversees the work of the UK security services • Diana Johnson MP, Labour shadow home affairs minister • Katy Clark, Labour MP • Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia The chair will be Andrew Noakes of the Labour Campaign for Human Rights. The event will take place in committee room six at the House of Parliament, starting at 6.15pm. I’ll live-blog it on a separate blog that well link to from here.    Updated at 2.57pm GMT     12.37pm GMT       Hans-Christian Ströbele, the German MP who met Snowden in Russia in October, has welcomed the ruling by a federal judge in Washington that the bulk collection of Americans’ telephone records by the National Security Agency is likely to violate the US constitution. Ströbele said:   The decision of the US Federal Court has now confirmed that the practices of the NSA revealed by Snowden, contradict the US constitution and also do not prevent acts of terrorism. If Snowdens revelations, if punishable at all, would be a political offence. His extradition would therefore be prohibited under the US extradition treaty if he came here. Such protection from extradition must also apply to Brazil, should Snowdens offer [of help] be accepted.      Edward Snowden and German MP Hans-Christian Strbele in Moscow in October. Photograph: IRINA OHO/HO/EPA         12.24pm GMT       Neither Brazils foreign ministry nor the presidential office said they had immediate comment on Edward Snowdens letter or any pending asylum request, reports the Associated Press.       12.03pm GMT       David Miranda, partner of former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, has started a petition on the Avaaz activist website calling for Brazil to grant Edward Snowden asylum. Miranda wrote on the website:   We have to thank a person for bringing us the truth and helping us fight the aggressive American espionage: Edward Snowden. He is public enemy No 1 in the US. He is someone I admire ... Edward is running out of time. He is on a temporary visa in Russia, and as a condition of his stay there he cannot talk to the press or help journalists or activists better understand how the US global spying machine works.  The term of his visa is running out, and we know what the US wants anyway: to bring him back to north American soil and put him in jail for the rest of his life – or worse. If Snowden was in Brazil, it is possible that he could do more to help the world understand how the NSA and its allies are invading the privacy of people around the world, and how we can protect ourselves ... He cannot do it in Russia.  Over 2,500 people have signed the petition so far. Michael Mohaelm of Avaaz said: “Snowden is now trapped alone in Russia on a short term visa. Brazil could offer him the heros welcome he deserves.”       11.46am GMT       The New York Times has been speaking to two people familiar with the “angry conversation” Angela Merkel had with Barack Obama after the monitoring of her phone was revealed. One said to the paper: “She told him, ‘This is like the Stasi.’” Merkel grew up in East Germany, where the feared secret police the Stasi infamously spied on the population to a then-unprecedented degree. The other person familiar with the conversation said the German chancellor had told the US president she was particularly angry because the Snowden disclosures indicated that “the NSA clearly couldn’t be trusted with private information, because they let Snowden clean them out.”  In the wake of the revelations about Merkel’s phone, Germany attempted to build a no-spying agreement with the US similar to the ones established (albeit, as it now turns out, imperfectly) between the Five Eyes: the US, UK, Australian, New Zealand and Canada. But the NYT also reports that this German effort is “floundering”, with the US only willing to give a no-spying guarantee to Merkel herself, not to the whole of Germany. The paper quotes a senior German official as saying of the US national security adviser: “Susan Rice has been very clear to us: the US is not going to set a precedent.”       10.58am GMT       David Miranda, the partner of former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, has posted what he says is the original English text of Snowdens letter on Facebook. Miranda is currently applying for judicial review of his nine-hour detention at Heathrow in August. The text reads:  Original Edward Snowden letter published on A Folha today. An open letter to the people of Brazil, from Edward Snowden Six months ago, I stepped out from the shadows of the United States Governments National Security Agency to stand in front of a journalists camera. I shared with the world evidence proving some governments are building a world-wide surveillance system to secretly track how we live, who we talk to, and what we say. I went in front of that camera with open eyes, knowing that the decision would cost me family and my home, and would risk my life. I was motivated by a belief that the citizens of the world deserve to understand the system in which they live.  My greatest fear was that no one would listen to my warning. Never have I been so glad to have been so wrong. The reaction in certain countries has been particularly inspiring to me, and Brazil is certainly one of those. At the NSA, I witnessed with growing alarm the surveillance of whole populations without any suspicion of wrongdoing, and it threatens to become the greatest human rights challenge of our time. The NSA and other spying agencies tell us that for our own safety—for Dilmas safety, for Petrobras safety—they have revoked our right to privacy and broken into our lives. And they did it without asking the public in any country, even their own. Today, if you carry a cell phone in Sao Paolo, the NSA can and does keep track of your location: they do this 5 billion times a day to people around the world. When someone in Florianopolis visits a website, the NSA keeps a record of when it happened and what you did there. If a mother in Porto Alegre calls her son to wish him luck on his university exam, NSA can keep that call log for five years or more. They even keep track of who is having an affair or looking at pornography, in case they need to damage their targets reputation. American Senators tell us that Brazil should not worry, because this is not surveillance, its data collection. They say it is done to keep you safe. They’re wrong. There is a huge difference between legal programs, legitimate spying, legitimate law enforcement — where individuals are targeted based on a reasonable, individualized suspicion — and these programs of dragnet mass surveillance that put entire populations under an all-seeing eye and save copies forever. These programs were never about terrorism: theyre about economic spying, social control, and diplomatic manipulation. Theyre about power. Many Brazilian senators agree, and have asked for my assistance with their investigations of suspected crimes against Brazilian citizens. I have expressed my willingness to assist wherever appropriate and lawful, but unfortunately the United States government has worked very hard to limit my ability to do so -- going so far as to force down the Presidential Plane of Evo Morales to prevent me from traveling to Latin America! Until a country grants permanent political asylum, the US government will continue to interfere with my ability to speak. Six months ago, I revealed that the NSA wanted to listen to the whole world. Now, the whole world is listening back, and speaking out, too. And the NSA doesnt like what its hearing. The culture of indiscriminate worldwide surveillance, exposed to public debates and real investigations on every continent, is collapsing. Only three weeks ago, Brazil led the United Nations Human Rights Committee to recognize for the first time in history that privacy does not stop where the digital network starts, and that the mass surveillance of innocents is a violation of human rights.  The tide has turned, and we can finally see a future where we can enjoy security without sacrificing our privacy. Our rights cannot be limited by a secret organization, and American officials should never decide the freedoms of Brazilian citizens. Even the defenders of mass surveillance, those who may not be persuaded that our surveillance technologies have dangerously outpaced democratic controls, now agree that in democracies, surveillance of the public must be debated by the public.  My act of conscience began with a statement: I dont want to live in a world where everything that I say, everything I do, everyone I talk to, every expression of creativity or love or friendship is recorded. Thats not something Im willing to support, its not something Im willing to build, and its not something Im willing to live under. Days later, I was told my government had made me stateless and wanted to imprison me. The price for my speech was my passport, but I would pay it again: I will not be the one to ignore criminality for the sake of political comfort. I would rather be without a state than without a voice. If Brazil hears only one thing from me, let it be this: when all of us band together against injustices and in defense of privacy and basic human rights, we can defend ourselves from even the most powerful systems.     Updated at 11.00am GMT     10.55am GMT       Edward Snowden has offered to help Brazil investigate US spying on its soil in exchange for political asylum, in an open letter from the NSA whistleblower to the Brazilian people published by the Folha de S Paulo newspaper. Ive expressed my willingness to assist where its appropriate and legal, but, unfortunately, the US government has been working hard to limit my ability to do so, Snowden said in the letter. Until a country grants me permanent political asylum, the US government will continue to interfere with my ability to speak out,” he said. Snowden – currently living in Russia, where he has been granted a year’s asylum until next summer – said he had been impressed by the Brazilian governments strong criticism of the NSA spy programme targeting internet and telecommunications worldwide, including the monitoring the mobile phone of the Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff has been one of the most vocal critics of the spying revealed by Snowden among world leaders. In September she launched a blistering attack on US espionage at the UN general assembly, with Barack Obama waiting in the wings to speak to next. The following month, she cancelled a visit to Washington that was to include a state dinner, and she has joined Germany in pushing for the UN to adopt a symbolic resolution that seeks to extend personal privacy rights to all people. Rousseff has also ordered her government to take measures including laying fibre-optic lines directly to Europe and South American nations in an effort to divorce Brazil from the US-centric backbone of the internet that experts say has facilitated NSA spying. Brazilian senators have asked for Snowdens help during hearings about the NSA programmes aggressive targeting of Brazil, an important transit hub for transatlantic fibre-optic cables. In his letter, Snowden used Brazilian examples to explain the extent of the US surveillance he had revealed. “Today, if you carry a cellphone in São Paulo, the NSA can track where you are, and it does – it does so 5bn times a day worldwide. “When a person in Florianópolis visits a website, the NSA keeps track of when it happened and what they did on that site. If a mother in Porto Alegre calls her son to wish him luck with his exam, the NSA can save the data for five years or longer. The agency can keep records of who has an affair or visits porn sites, in case it needs to damage the reputations of its targets.” He added: “Six months ago, I revealed that the NSA wanted to listen to the whole world. Now the whole world is listening, and also talking back. And the NSA does not like what it is hearing.” Snowden’s offer comes a day after the White House dashed hopes that the US might be considering an amnesty for the whistleblower, insisting he should still return to the US to stand trial. Asked about weekend comments by senior NSA official Richard Ledgett suggesting that an amnesty was “worth talking about” if Snowden returned the missing NSA documents, White House spokesman Jay Carney said: “Our position has not changed on that matter – at all. He [Ledgett] was expressing his personal opinion; these decisions are made by the Department of Justice.” Also on Monday a US district judge ruled that the NSAs bulk collection of millions of Americans telephone records probably violates the US constitutions ban on unreasonable search. The case is likely to go all the way the supreme court for a final decision. Snowden responded to that decision with a public statement that said: “Today, a secret program authorised by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans’ rights. It is the first of many.” The Guardian first published accounts of the NSAs spy programmes in June, based on some of the thousands of documents Snowden handed over to the Brazil-based American journalist Glenn Greenwald and his reporting partner Laura Poitras, a US filmmaker. Early morning calls to Brazils presidential office and to the foreign ministry for comment were not answered.    Updated at 11.04am GMT     9.56am GMT       Welcome to our hub for all Edward Snowden, NSA and GCHQ-related developments around the world. As arguments rage over how much of our day to day life should be monitored in the name of security, well be tracking the growing global debate about privacy in the digital age. Wed like to know what you think about the whole NSA story, what youre worried about – and any new areas youd like to read more about. Good morning. Here are the headlines: • Edward Snowden has offered to help Brazil investigate US spying on its soil in exchange for political asylum, the NSA whistleblower has suggested in an open letter to the Brazilian people published by the Folha de S Paulo newspaper. Ive expressed my willingness to assist where its appropriate and legal, but, unfortunately, the US government has been working hard to limit my ability to do so, said the letter. Until a country grants me permanent political asylum, the US government will continue to interfere with my ability to speak out.” • Yesterday, the White House dashed hopes that the US might be considering an amnesty for Snowden, insisting he should still return to the US to stand trial. Asked about weekend comments by senior NSA official Richard Ledgett suggesting that an amnesty was “worth talking about” if Snowden returned the missing NSA documents, White House spokesman Jay Carney said: “Our position has not changed on that matter – at all. He was expressing his personal opinion; these decisions are made by the Department of Justice.” • A federal judge in Washington ruled on Monday that the bulk collection of Americans’ telephone records by the National Security Agency is likely to violate the US constitution, in the most significant legal setback for the agency since the publication of the first surveillance disclosures by Snowden. The New York Times explains the background to the case:  The case was brought by several plaintiffs led by Larry Klayman, a conservative legal activist. Mr Klayman, who represented himself and the other plaintiffs, said in an interview on Monday that he was seeking to turn the case into a class action on behalf of all Americans. “I’m extremely gratified that Judge [Richard] Leon had the courage to make this ruling,” he said. “He is an American hero” … Similar legal challenges to the NSA program, including by the American Civil Liberties Union and the advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation, are at earlier stages in the courts.  • The move prompted a public statement from Snowden, currently in Russia where he has been granted a year’s asylum. The NSA whistleblower said:  I acted on my belief that the NSAs mass surveillance programs would not withstand a constitutional challenge, and that the American public deserved a chance to see these issues determined by open courts. Today, a secret program authorised by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans’ rights. It is the first of many.  • Here Spencer Ackerman analyses the CBS News documentary whose interview with Ledgett produced the US amnesty idea. Ackerman says the NSA made a number of dubious claims in the programme, from the extent of surveillance to collecting on Google and Yahoo data centers to an online “kill-switch” for the global financial system developed by China. • In Britain, the home secretary, Theresa May, faced criticism from MPs for failing to provide evidence to support the melodramatic soundbites of Britains spy agencies claiming that revelations from the whistleblower Edward Snowden had damaged the UKs national security. You can read Andrew Sparrow’s live blog of that session here, and Michael White’s sketch here. Here’s an extract from the sketch:  Time and time again members of the notorious home affairs select committee asked Theresa May the same questions, hoping she would crack ... Is the Guardian editor, Alan Rusbridger, a menace for publishing Edward Snowdens datamining leaks? Definitely, though May was unable to say quite why, except that Parker had said so. And why wont you let Parker give his own explanation to them as well as to the intelligence and security committee? This was a tough one because even Rusbridger-baiting Tories such as Michael Ellis were offended by it. May kept saying it is because thats the way its done, not because the intelligence committee agrees the questions (and possibly the answers) in advance. Perhaps Rusbridger is right, Ellis suggested in an attempt to get her to say something interesting. It failed.  • This evening the Guardian editor will be taking part in a panel discussion in parliament on the extent of GCHQ’s surveillance powers, along with the former director of that intelligence agency Sir David Omand, Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia, and others. I’ll live blog it on a separate blog from 6pm. More on that shortly.    Updated at 2.57pm GMT
