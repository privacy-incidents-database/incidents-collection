Leaked Snowden Documents Show Expansion of Cybersurveillance by U.S. Agencies
As the threat of malicious hacking has grown, the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have secretly expanded their surveillance of Internet communications flowing to and from the United States. The N.S.A. gained approval in 2012 to use its warrantless surveillance program to target Internet addresses, malware, and other cybersignatures associated with foreign governments, and it has pushed to remove limits on that power. Around that time, the F.B.I. gained court approval to target particular foreign Internet addresses for its own cybersecurity investigations. These moves were not disclosed to the public, but they are revealed in these and other documents provided to  and ProPublica by the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden.
