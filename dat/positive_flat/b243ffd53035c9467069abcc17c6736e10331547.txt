A sordid orgy and why Max Mosley can't be allowed to erase history
More than any man on earth, the former Formula One racing chief Max Mosley is trying to rewrite the rules that have governed the workings of a free Press for many years, not just in this country but throughout Europe.His latest assault is on the internet giant Google. He has been trying to persuade a French court that the web engine should be prevented from directing users to pictures of a private orgy that he organised five years ago.The photographs, involving Mr Mosley and five consensual prostitutes, were originally published by the now defunct News of the World in March 2008. It alleged that Mr Mosley had been engaged in a sick Nazi orgy.
Mr Mosley has been trying to persuade a French court that Google should be prevented from directing users to pictures of a private orgy that he organised five years ago
Google's response to Mr Mosley is that the application of filters would amount to a form of censorship
To the astonishment of many, three months later Mr Mosley won damages of 60,000 in the High Court from the paper, which was held to have invaded his privacy. Although German was spoken, uniforms worn and blood was shed by Mosley during the proceedings, and despite heads apparently being inspected as though for lice, the learned judge declared there was no evidence that this had been a Nazi orgy.Mr Justice Eady ruled that if it had been a Nazi orgy he might have found in favour of the newspaper, since Mr Mosley was a public figure of sorts whose suitability for his high-profile job would have been seriously called into question by such antics. As there was no such proof, the paper was required to pay damages and costs.Buoyed by this significant (and to my mind irrational) verdict, Mr Mosley set about trying to restrict the activities of the Press. In 2011 he argued in the European Court of Human Rights that prior notification should be compulsory for newspapers, to give their targets time to obtain an injunction preventing publication.
(left to right) Woman D, Woman B and Woman C, above and a fourth, Woman A, all denied there was any Nazi element to the orgy at the trial against the News of The World
In other words, a politician or businessman caught doing something wrong could try to persuade a sympathetic judge to kill off the story. Mercifully, the Court had a fit of good sense, and seven of its judges ruled that the right to freedom of expression would be at risk if pre-notification was compulsory.But Mr Mosley was, and is, a man obsessed. One way or another the Press must be curbed. His lawyers have just argued in front of French judges that Google should apply filters so that people would be unable to access photographs of his orgy.
If Mr Mosley had his way, it would not be long before George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four became one step closer to reality
The unwary might suppose that this is perfectly reasonable. If the News of the World was, according to an English judge, guilty of invading Mr Mosleys privacy when it originally published photographs of his orgy, why should those photographs be available on the net?Googles response is that the application of filters would amount to a form of censorship. Access to news sites carrying the pictures, or to innocuous articles containing the images, might be blocked. In short, the prohibition would extend much further than the photographs.If anything, Google is understating the case. Should Mr Mosley get his way, the consequence could be the rewriting or erasing of chunks of history. Whether or not his privacy was invaded, the photographs exist and no one has challenged their authenticity. They amount to a historical record of a sordid event which indubitably took place. Decent people might wish that it hadnt, but it did.These images continue to exist not only on the net but in libraries and private homes. If they were wiped out on the internet  actually, they physically cant be, but access to them can be denied  they would logically have to be destroyed wherever else they might survive. That sounds like a police state.If Mr Mosley wins this battle, his next step might be to request that any articles which so much as referred to the pictures of his orgy, or the orgy itself, should also be destroyed, possibly including this one.
Mr Mosley, pictured here with F1 models in Barcelona, faced calls for his resignation when the story was published
want to rewrite their pasts would also apply to have access blocked to
discreditable information about them on the internet. In fact, its
European Unions highest court is considering whether Spains privacy
regulator may have overstepped the mark when trying to force Google to
remove unflattering search results for numerous citizens  for example, a
doctor who claimed that a 1991 news article about a dispute with a
patient had damaged his business.Of course, libellous or untrue articles can, and should, be taken off the net. Google says it has removed hundreds of such pages relating to Mr Mosley following requests from him.Equally, the search engine should do much more to block access to extreme pornographic websites. But such a welcome move does not involve the rewriting of history to which Mr Mosleys innovations would lead us.

I exaggerate? I dont think so. Mr Mosley does not like freedom much.
At a meeting of a Commons select committee in March he shocked
observers. He suggested that access to foreign-based websites could be
blocked if they flouted tough new rules that might be introduced by
British regulators. Thats what they do in dictatorships such as Iran
and China.Its surely no accident that Mr Mosley should have started his assault on freedom in France, a country with ferocious privacy laws in which newspapers are traditionally cowed by politicians and the courts.Until shortly before his death, French newspapers did not dare reveal the truth about the war record, private life and financial misdemeanours of former president Francois Mitterrand.For example, there was scant discussion of the period during the early years of World War II when he supported Petains pro-German Vichy regime, and allegations that he protected Nazi collaborators who helped deport French Jews to death camps were also downplayed. It was only in the months before his death that the Press revealed that Mitterrand had fathered an illegitimate child by a secret mistress.The French court will deliver its verdict on Mr Mosleys latest legal challenge, subject to appeal, on October 21. Meanwhile, he is also challenging Google in the German courts. He is aiming for Europe-wide controls on the web engine  and of course he has lots of money.Though he has denied giving donations to Hacked Off, the pressure group campaigning for tougher regulation of British newspapers, he is a supporter of the organisation and has reportedly financed hacking victims lawyers. Will Hacked Off now condemn him for wishing to censor the internet? Of course not. What Mr Mosley yearns for, Hacked Off also wants.He is a very wealthy man who organised a sordid orgy which the News of the World could have justly described as German-themed. Nevertheless, he won his case. Meanwhile, that newspaper has been closed down for unconnected reasons.But that is not enough for him. His war of vengeance against the Press continues. It as if newspapers must suffer because he has been damaged.He blames everyone except himself. It seems never to occur to Max Mosley that he may have acted unwisely or wrongly. In trying to bury his unwholesome past, this peculiar man would, if he could, cheerfully dismantle all our freedoms.
