So Theresa May has breasts – who knew?

The UK press went into meltdown yesterday over a shocking incident in which a woman-shaped human took part in politics. Despite wearing a smart red suit, the home secretary, Theresa May, our most senior female politician, found herself discussed under headlines referring to the “busty budget” and her “boob-boosting push-up bra”.

In fact, there is a detailed and shameful history of such incidents going back decades. We might think we have moved on entirely from the days when Nancy Astor, the UK’s first sitting female MP, was frozen out by Winston Churchill and told by a male colleague that he would push his stomach up against hers any time she liked. But the treatment of today’s female MPs sometimes suggests we have barely moved forward at all. It’s actually just one year since the last time May was accused of “flashing her cleavage” during the budget, in articles that dubbed her “May-dy in red” and suggested the cabinet member and MP of nearly two decades was “usually better known for her choice of shoes”. Last year, too, MP Alison McGovern shared a letter from a Channel 4 news viewer who kindly wrote to inform her: “As a Labour member might I say that your prominent cleavage distracted your male observers from hearing what you were saying.” This led, naturally, to news articles about “an MP accused of flaunting her cleavage on national television”. (2015 was also the same year in which MPs staunchly argued against allowing female parliamentarians to breastfeed in the Commons chamber.) And just a year earlier, commentators capitalised on another situation in which May wore a perfectly smart and suitable outfit to do her job, when they ran headlines about the “optical illusion” pattern on a dress which they claimed left “MPs goggle-eyed” despite showing no flesh whatsoever. In 2012, columnist Toby Young managed to omit the head and humanity of the female politician in question altogether when he tweeted during prime minister’s questions: “Serious cleavage behind @Ed_Miliband’s head. Anyone know who it belongs to? #pmqs” He later added: “Breaking: Cleavage belongs to @pamela_nash #pmqs”. In 2007, despite wearing an outfit that showed not one solitary hint of her bra, May was the subject of a Daily Mail article that began: “Of course, we should all be interested in what the shadow leader of the House of Commons was talking about, but what I want to know is: was she wearing a leopard-skin bra?” The article went on to painstakingly compare May’s cleavage to that of then home secretary Jacqui Smith, which it helpfully described as “a rather middle-aged, squeezed together line of amplitude, about three inches long … A little desperate, if anything, and designed to draw the eye down from the face and slim the chins away. Certainly not sexy.” Around the same time, while Smith continued to battle with irrelevant headlines about the “dynamite down her cleavage”, the Sun, realising this was a developing issue that might become confusing to the public, helpfully stepped in to provide a “Best of Breastminster” feature, ranking the “ministerial boobs”.

The problem is also international, with politicians including Canadian Christy Clark, former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard and US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton facing similar furious speculation over the small line between their breasts. Nor is the puerile obsession with female politicians’ bodies restricted to the media alone. A report released in 2004 revealed that women MPs endured “shocking” levels of abuse at the hands of their male colleagues, including male MPs pretending to jiggle imaginary breasts and jeering about “melons” as women made Commons speeches. Members of the public are also keen to get in on the act. Stella Creasy MP (whose name, incidentally, when typed into Google, is followed by “husband” and “married” as two of the most popular five suggested searches) has endured extreme and terrifying online abuse, including a threat to cut off her breasts and use them to make a kebab. And during yesterday’s budget, one heroic soul took it upon himself to start a Twitter account in the name of “Theresa May’s Boobs”. Finally, as if feverish ongoing speculation over her anatomy wasn’t enough, one news outlet continues to run an open poll asking members of the public whether they would “snog, marry or avoid” Theresa May.

Labour MP Yvette Cooper recently warned that sexist abuse risks putting a generation of girls off entering politics, and young women frequently tell me, when I visit their schools and universities to discuss sexism and gender issues, that they see politics as a “man’s game”, in part because of the press treatment of female MPs. If women do decide to run for office, there is evidence that sexist remarks in the media can undermine their chances – a 2010 US study found that voters were less likely to vote for candidates who had been the subject of such name calling. And even when women do ignore the potential risks, and campaign successfully for political office, such abuse is likely to make them think twice before speaking out in the chamber. It might also prevent them from staying in the political arena, according to a 2014 Fawcett Society report that highlighted experiences of sexism as a common reason for women in local government roles stepping down. We can only continue to speculate over how long it will be before women are able to participate in political processes without parts of their bodies being considered more important than the words coming out of their mouths. Of course, in brighter news, there was one occasion on which an MP stood up to raise precisely these issues in Westminster itself, when Caroline Lucas rose in a “No more Page 3” T-shirt to discuss the objectification of women in the public sphere. The outcome? She was asked to cover up.
