Privacy board testifies to Congress on report rebuking NSA surveillance
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/12/privacy-board-testifies-congress-nsa-surveillance-live
  5.25pm GMT    Summary    We’re going to end our Capitol Hill live blog coverage for the morning. Here’s a summary of where things stand: • Members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board told Congress that bulk phone records collection under Section 215 of the Patriot Act should end. The board also recommended that a public advocate be added to the Fisa court. • The board was split over whether Section 215 surveillance is legal. One member of the board felt that the panel should never have touched the question. Board member James Dempsey said that nobody had looked more closely at the legal foundation of 215 spying. • The board was split on how surveillance programs should be made more transparent. Dempsey said transparency in the law was more important that operational transparency: “The better way... I think.. is to have a statute that clearly authorizes bulk collection, or doesn’t authorize bulk collection.” • Dempsey said Internet companies would likely not be as willing to support greater transparency in government surveillance as would telephone companies. “I think there may be a split between what the telephone companies want to do, and what the Internet companies would want to do,” he said. • Senator Richard Blumenthal questioned the efficacy of Section 215 surveillance because it only nets about 30% of domestic US phone records, he said: “Doesn’t this disclosure, that only 30% of these records were actually collected, because of the explosion in cell phone use... raise questions not only about the efficacy of the program but also about the legal foundation?” • Next up for the board: A review is under way of Section 702 surveillance under the Fisa Amendments Act, which applies to international communications. One board member said the 702 program had been useful where the 215 program has not been.  • Board members said they became aware of Section 215 surveillance only shortly before the Snowden revelations.  • Blumenthal said intelligence agents apply a logarithm to a phone database to search it. Board member Judge Patricia Wald said agents use RAS searches – for Reasonable Articulable Suspicion – to look at one number, but then “you get a wider and wider swath” when you take three hops from the first number.  • Two board members who dissented with the finding that Section 215 collection is illegal described their views. One said a finding on legality was outside the board’s purview and “has a very demoralizing and negative effect on the intelligence community... you don’t want them to be timid or scared about the rug being pulled out from under them.”    Updated at 5.40pm GMT     4.50pm GMT       There’s a Senate vote. Blumenthal adjourns the hearing.  Felt like kind of a quickie outing for PCLOB. That’s what years of unsupported work and a 238-page report will get you: 110 minutes before the half-dozen members of Congress who bothered to show up at your hearing.        4.46pm GMT       Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, says he doubts whether another patch of oversight will “make a huge margin of difference” when there’s already a “quilt” of oversight of intelligence programs. Isn’t a different solution needed? he asks. Dempsey says the board agreed in principle, and that’s why the board pulled back to look at the legal foundation, which they found to be cracked and crumbling. “We took, remarkably, the most-in-depth look at effectiveness... and again concluded that the program came up short,” he says. He’s referring to language in the PCLOB report like this:  We are aware of no instance in which the program directly contributed to the discovery of a previously unknown terrorist plot or the disruption of a terrorist attack.        4.42pm GMT       Wald is discussing how quickly a search of one phone number can turn into a “wider and wider swath” of surveillance.  She refers to “the so-called RAS’s” whereby agents query the database. RAS stands for reasonable articulable suspicion. The board has been told there are “in the area of 300 [RAS’s] a year.” “What we don’t know is how many numbers on a first hop, or a second hop, or a third hop you can get,” Wald says:  When you get the first hop... what happens is the analysts look at all the numbers that pop up... they may say... that’s of no interest to us... so may only look at one out of 12...or they may look at them all. Then you go to the second hop... and you get a wider and wider swath.        4.31pm GMT       Brand says she can’t talk about the details of the collection program, but implies that the hope is that the government will find a way to step up from that 30% collection to closer to 100% collection. She’s basically saying, don’t abandon universal bulk collection just because it isn’t perfect yet or perfectly thorough.       4.29pm GMT       Blumenthal says if only 30% of phone records are collected, what is the purpose or use of the 215 program? It’s a way of flipping the argument that bulk collection is somehow better or OK if it does not apply to everyone.  “If you’re looking for a needle in a haystack, you have to have the entire haystack to look through,” Blumenthal quotes a judicial ruling as saying. Blumenthal continues:  In this instance, the rational for this program is that all of the data has to be collected, so that connections can be made, algorithms can be applied... doesn’t this disclosure, that only 30% of these records were actually collected, because of the explosion in cell phone use... raise questions not only about the efficacy of the program but also about the legal foundation?      Blumenthal prolly wasnt supposed to say algorithms were applied.Its SEKRIT. emptywheel (@emptywheel) February 12, 2014      Updated at 4.34pm GMT     4.23pm GMT       Senator Hatch says the president’s review group on intelligence and communications concluded that section 215 was legal. That is wrong. The report is here.     Hatch falsely claims the other review group concluded the 215 program was legal. Julian Sanchez (@normative) February 12, 2014      Updated at 4.23pm GMT     4.07pm GMT       Brand says a “board like ours which performs primarily an advisory function... has to pick and choose” what to address. She thinks PCLOB should not have gotten into the legality of the program. “This program has been operating for years, it’s been the subject of numerous judicial opinions,” the legality will ultimately be resolved before the courts, she says. Then Brand says it’s harmful to call the program illegal because it hurts the intelligence community’s feelings. Saying this collection is illegal “has a very demoralizing and negative effect on the intelligence community... you don’t want them to be timid or scared about the rug being pulled out from under them.” That is not the opinion of the majority of the board.    Dempsey: No body, not FISC, not Exec looked at statute as carefully as we did.(And no other Circuit Court Judge has) emptywheel (@emptywheel) February 12, 2014      Updated at 4.12pm GMT     4.02pm GMT       PCLOB has just begun a report on Section 702 collection, Wald says.  “That program was openly debated,” she says. “The fact that how the program would operate in terms of the courts approving a target, or minimization, and what kinds of category of material could be targeted” ... many of this is right in the statute. “The government itself has said the 702 program has been very very valuable to it.. and much more valuable” than section 215 collection, Wald says.       4.00pm GMT       Brand says that where programs can be revealed they should be, but only insofar as national security permits.  “It’s difficult to draw conclusions about what can safely be disclosed publicly” from past disclosures, Cook says. She is eerily robotic in her delivery.        3.52pm GMT       Senator Al Franken says the government still hasn’t given “even a rough estimate” of how many numbers have been collected under Section 215, and under current law the government doesn’t have to. Franken has introduced legislation that would require the government to disclose how many numbers have been collected and how many queries of the data have been conducted. What level of transparency is needed? he asks.  Dempsey, the civil liberties advocate, says “once anybody publishes a number, say a million of our customers are affected, then that basically says there’s a bulk collection program directed against our entity. And I believe that’s sensitive information.” Franken: Huh? The companies support greater transparency. They support my bill. Dempsey: “I think there may be a split between what the telephone companies want to do, and what the Internet companies would want to do. ... I see a legitimate security concern about naming or identifying or singling out...    Dempsey delicately notes that telecoms dont want transparency, Internet companies do. Wonder why (hahaha)? emptywheel (@emptywheel) February 12, 2014    Franken: “You don’t have to single out.” We just want a number of numbers collected. Dempsey: “The better way... I think.. is to have a statute that clearly authorizes bulk collection, or doesn’t authorize bulk collection.” Dempsey says the current statute does not authorize bulk collection. “To me that kind of legislative transparency is honestly more important than some of the operational transparency.”    Updated at 4.13pm GMT     3.45pm GMT       Grassley asks Brand, one of the former Bush officials, why she disagreed with the board’s finding that Section 215 surveillance is not legal. She says the legal reasoning is 50 pages long, but the key bit is a distinction between national security investigations and criminal investigations. In a grand jury context, information must be relevant to criminal investigation, she says; in the Fisa context, information must be relevant to a Fisa investigation, which is of necessity broader and open-ended, Brand says.    There is no such thing as a “FISA Investigation” Julian Sanchez (@normative) February 12, 2014    Brand says the 215 program is not a privacy infringement because it only collects metadata, not “content”. (Former CIA director Michael Morell is one of many to have said that metadata is at least as important as content; “There is quite a bit” of information that can be gleaned from phone metadata,” Morell told Congress last month. “There is not in my mind a sharp distinction between metadata and content.”) Brand said 215 is not a privacy infringement because the “use of the program is incredibly strictly limited” and there are “numerous levels of oversight.”    Updated at 3.46pm GMT     3.37pm GMT       Blumenthal asks about a public advocate on the Fisa court. He says the advocate should have discretion as to what cases to get involved in. Judge Wald agrees that it should not be purely up to the Fisa court to decide which cases an advocate can jump in on. She says in her experience, it’s difficult for a judge alone to make the call of when a public advocate would be appropriate. Especially in technologically complex cases, and even with the best kind of counsel, she says.       3.31pm GMT       Blumenthal begins. What if bulk data collection did not include every citizen’s phone records, but only a portion of phone records? Medine says it needs to be a classified discussion. In any case, he says, a smaller proportion still would comprise a very large number of records, and the conclusion of the board would be the same.       3.26pm GMT       Medine, the board chairman, introduces the board’s case. He says the board held classified briefings with DNI, NSA, DoJ, FBI and CIA, presidential staff, Fisa staff and others. The board received a demonstration of Section 215’s operation and capabilities at the NSA. “The board recommends that the government end the program,” he says.       3.18pm GMT       Is the secret bulk collection of phone metadata legal?  Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has announced a lawsuit against NSA to challenge the practice. Paul’s suit builds on at least two cases making their ways through the criminal court system that could result in a Supreme Court ruling on the issue.  A criminal defendant in Colorado filed a motion in late January to suppress evidence prosecutors have admitted was collected through warrantless eavesdropping. Also last month, an Oregon man found guilty of a plot to set off a car bomb at a Christmas tree-lighting ceremony filed a motion challenging the constitutionality of the Fisa Amendments Act. Read more about those cases here. A previous constitutional challenge to the law, brought by lawyers and journalists, was set aside by the supreme court last year on the grounds that the group could not prove the government would monitor their communications specifically and so did not have standing in the case.    Just like ACLU has RT @TheWire Rand Paul sues the NSA in the most elaborate email collection scheme in history http://t.co/VBzPByFZQZ Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) February 12, 2014         3.10pm GMT       Senator Richard Blumenthal gavels the hearing into session. He praises the board for producing a thorough report under time pressure and with little staff support. He says the report’s conclusions are shocking, in the extent of phone data collection they revealed and in the secrecy of the legal rulings permitting that collection with no congressional review.  The PCLOB did not function between 2008-2012 because none of the positions on the board were filled. The four current members were confirmed in August 2012. Board members testifying today are:  Chairman David Medine Retired federal judge Patricia Wald Former justice department official Rachel L Brand  Civil liberties advocate James X Dempsey Former justice department official Elisebeth Collins Cook       2.17pm GMT       Good morning and welcome to our live blog coverage of testimony before Congress of the five members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board on Reforms. In January the panel recommended that the government should end the bulk collection of phone metadata under section 215 of the Patriot Act and that the database should be purged. It is the sharpest official rebuke of NSA surveillance activities to date. The 238-page PCLOB report said the panel could not find “a single instance” in which the program “made a concrete difference in the outcome of a terrorism investigation”: “Moreover, we are aware of no instance in which the program directly contributed to the discovery of a previously unknown terrorist plot or the disruption of a terrorist attack,” the report said. The PCLOB is an independent, bipartisan panel appointed by the president and approved by Congress. It was established to challenge executive branch overreach after the 9/11 attacks. Two members of the board, Rachel L Brand and Elisebeth Collins Cook, lawyers who served in the Justice Department under President George W Bush, dissented with its finding that bulk collection under Section 215 was likely illegal. The other members of the board are chairman David Medine, retired federal judge Patricia Wald, and civil liberties advocate James X Dempsey. In testimony before the judiciary committee last month, a separate oversight panel, hand-selected by President Barack Obama, recommended that the database of phone records be moved out of government hands. A wide range of elected officials, civil liberties groups, technology companies, a federal judge and others have called for the government to stop suspicionless surveillance of US citizens.
