Twitter Says It Was Not Hacked - 
After many Twitter users received e-mails on Thursday morning asking them to reset the passwords to their Twitter accounts, many suspected that they, or the company, had been hacked.

But on Thursday morning, a large number of Twitter users took to the platform to complain that they had received the e-mail and worried they had been hacked.
Twitter said it had mistakenly reset passwords for more people than it it intended on Thursday.
