Andrew Bergman's play ''Social Security,'' which was to have opened on Broadway on March 27, has been postponed at least one week because its director, Mike Nichols, has experienced chest pains, according to a spokesman for the show.
Mr. Nichols reported the pains following a rehearsal in New York on Tuesday and, on his doctor's recommendation, entered a hospital for observation and testing.
Tests found no major problem and Mr. Nichols was released early yesterday. He is now resting at his home in Manhattan.
Rehearsals are expected to resume in early February and a revised schedule, including an out-of-town tryout, will be announced at that time. The comedy about art, money, sex and motherhood stars Marlo Thomas and Ron Silver.
