The Girlfriend Experience: Dont Call It a Remake
In his 2009 film The Girlfriend Experience, Steven Soderbergh focused his gaze on Chelsea, a high-end New York escort (played by the porn star Sasha Grey) grappling with the waning of her career during the financial crisis. But the new Starz series of the same title, on which Mr. Soderbergh is an executive producer, isnt exactly a remake. Now, Chelsea (the alluringly dispassionate Riley Keough, Elvis Presleys granddaughter) is a Chicago law student and intern who undertakes prostitution for money, control and, not incidentally, sex without attachment.This isnt to say that relationships, or an approximation thereof, dont develop. But as Chelsea plies her johns with a facsimile of the devotion and tenderness they might be missing at home, or satisfies their fetishes and her own, her power  and our pleasure  lies as much in her intellectualism and transactional savvy as it does in sexual acrobatics. This 13-episode, half-hour drama can be savored weekly, starting on Sunday, April 10, at 8 p.m., or binged on Starz Play and Starz On Demand.
