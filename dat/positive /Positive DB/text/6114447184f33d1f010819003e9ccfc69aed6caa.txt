The younger generation doesnt care, he said. If they can click on the phone, walk to the corner and pick it up, they are fine.Ms. Noone, who was born in Bay Ridge 75 years ago and has lived there for all but her grammar school days, said the three-square-mile community overlooking New York Harbor provides both the convenience of the city and the feel of a village.

Its like a small town here, said Ms. Noone, who grew up in a house on 89th Street where her brother-in-laws family still lives and raised two children with her husband in a two-family home on Sixth Avenue and 82nd. Widowed, she now owns a co-op on Shore Road, down the street from where her daughter lives. A lot of people here are just like me.Andrew S. Gounardes, 30, who is counsel to Brooklyn Borough President Eric L. Adams and the immediate past president of the Bay Ridge Historical Society, grew up in the neighborhood and returned after attending law school in Washington, D.C. He (and his sister and brother) had the same English teacher that his mother had, at Fort Hamilton High School.
I liken it to a modern-day Mayberry, he said. It has old-school charm while it continues to reinvent itself. Continue reading the main story
Among the neighborhoods newer residents are Chris Lowery, 46, an assistant director of building design and exhibitions at the City University of New York Graduate Center, and Suzie Treinen, 44, an art teacher at the Spence School in Manhattan. They bought a 111-year-old four-bedroom rowhouse at 139 68th Street in March when they, their two daughters and dog outgrew their 590-square-foot co-op in Windsor Terrace. With the move, the girls got their own bedrooms and Sensei, the Tibetan spaniel, a yard.They paid $882,500 and are spending as much as $90,000 on renovations, including a new kitchen. The owner of Coszcal de Allende, a local restaurant, said shed cook for us anytime, since we just have a sink, Mr. Lowery said. We stumbled on Bay Ridge, and pretty quickly it became clear that we were enthusiastic.

She said the neighborhood was definitely more interested in quality of life issues than some others.
Bay Ridge is always described as a small town in a big city, and you know, it really is like that, she added. But Ive heard that it is getting tougher for people who grew up here to stay here, because the housing market is expensive.What Youll FindBay Ridge looks like a chili pepper; by one popular definition, it is encircled by the Belt Parkway on the west and the Gowanus Expressway on the east. At the southern tip, the roads connect to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, a soaring and omnipresent expanse that links Brooklyn with Staten Island.While many of the Scandinavians who once predominated are gone, Bay Ridge still has a strong population of Italian and Irish descent and has drawn Greek, Arabic, Russian and Chinese residents. The neighborhood has the highest concentration of people in Brooklyn who speak Arabic at home, according to the Arab American Association of New York, which is based there.Vistas along many of the streets are similar  attached one and two-family rowhouses, some with driveways and yards, set on ample, neat sidewalks. There are also detached single-family homes, condos and co-ops and a small number of free-standing colonials and Tudors. Along Shore Road in Fort Hamilton, the southern section of Bay Ridge, six-story apartment complexes are among the neighborhoods tallest buildings. Rezoning in 2005 preserved the low elevations of the housing stock.

Two express buses, the X27 and the X37, travel to and from Manhattan, in 30 to 45 minutes.The HistoryThe Dutch West India Company acquired the land from the Nyack Indians in 1652 and called it Yellow Hook, for the color of the clay there, according to the 1998 book The Neighborhoods of Brooklyn, by Kenneth T. Jackson and John B. Manbeck. After the yellow fever epidemic in 1849, though, residents renamed the area for the bay and the glacial ridge running through the neighborhood, which soon became a seaside retreat.
