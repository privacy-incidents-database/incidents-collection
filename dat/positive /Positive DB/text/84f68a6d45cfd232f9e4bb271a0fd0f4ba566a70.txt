F.B.I. Chief Presses Congress to Act on Data Privacy
James B. Comey Jr., the F.B.I. director, spoke during a House Select Intelligence Committee hearing on Thursday.
WASHINGTON  The head of the F.B.I., battling Apple over unlocking an iPhone used by one of the killers in a December rampage in San Bernardino, Calif., called on Congress on Thursday to settle the question of when law enforcement officials should get access to citizens private data.The larger question isnt going to be answered in the courts, and shouldnt be, the F.B.I. chief, James B. Comey Jr., told lawmakers at a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee. Its really about who do we want to be as a country and how do we want to govern ourselves.Apple has argued that granting the governments request to build software to unlock the phone at issue would compromise the security of all the devices used by its hundreds of millions of customers. But Mr. Comey said the case was unlikely to be a trailblazer, because encryption technology is changing so quickly.The San Bernardino litigation is not about us trying to send a message or establish some precedent, Mr. Comey said. It really isnt. Its about trying to be competent in investigating something that is an active investigation.At the same time, he acknowledged that the question of whether a company like Apple should have to unlock its encryption technology is the hardest question Ive seen in government, and its going to require negotiation and conversation.
Apple has said it will not comply with a federal court order to unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino attackers. Commenters online weigh privacy versus security in an age of terrorism.
He said that Congress was in the best position to establish clearer lines on such issues. It is this body that should be determining the answers, he said.But answers from Congress appear doubtful. Several lawmakers who questioned Mr. Comey acknowledged that they were uncertain where the line should be drawn between consumer privacy and the needs of law enforcement. Other lawmakers said that, with Congress gridlocked on far less complicated issues, a resolution seemed highly unlikely.
Officials in the Obama administration drafted legislation beginning in 2011 that sought to address some of the encryption issues now being raised. But their proposals were effectively shelved in 2013 when leaks by Edward J. Snowden ignited public concerns about government spying.The hearing on Thursday was intended to discuss global threats with intelligence leaders government-wide but was instead dominated by questions for Mr. Comey about the Apple dispute.In the San Bernardino case, the F.B.I. is trying to get Apples technical assistance in unlocking the phone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people in December. A judge in California last week ordered Apple to cooperate, but the company has resisted.Apple on Thursday filed a formal brief
in opposition to the order, arguing that the Justice Department and the F.B.I. were overreaching with their demands.
Microsoft will file a brief backing Apple next week in a federal court in California, the companys president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, said on Thursday.Microsoft was one of the few prominent technology companies that had not yet clearly backed Apple in the case. Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter have all backed Apple in the case. But Microsoft had previously supported Apple only indirectly through a statement issued by an industry coalition.A report by The Financial Times, suggesting that Bill Gates, a Microsoft founder, had sided with the government in the case, caused a stir this week. Mr. Gates, who is no longer an executive at the company, later said the newspaper had mischaracterized his position in the interview.Mr. Smith, the Microsoft official, was speaking Thursday at a congressional hearing tangentially related to the Apple case, one focused on international legal conflicts related to data flowing across borders. Microsoft is fighting cases in courts in the United States and Brazil related to law enforcement demands for data held overseas and is pressing Congress to modernize laws to reduce these conflicts.
Apples chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has suggested that Congress is a better place than a court to work out the conflicts arising in its case, and Mr. Smith said that we agree wholeheartedly with Apple that the right place to bring this discussion is here to the House of Representatives and the Senate so people elected by the people can make these decisions.In the Apple case, the government is relying on the All Writs Act, passed in its current form in 1911. To emphasize his point that law enforcement authorities are relying on outdated laws, Mr. Smith placed on a table an antique adding machine he had purchased on eBay.The leading computing device from that era is right in front of me, he said.
