To the Editor:Re Rejected by Colleges, SAT and ACT Gain High School Acceptance (front page, April 6):Standardized tests by their very nature leave much to be desired. They tend to measure two things: students socioeconomic status and how much time has been taken away from meaningful learning in order to teach test-taking skills.But the adoption of the SAT or ACT as a mandatory statewide high school exam is objectionable for reasons that go way beyond whats wrong with tests in general  or even the tests developed to enforce the problematic Common Core standards.Its bad enough to require students who are not college-bound to take a test that was intended specifically for those who are. Its even worse  indeed, a violation of the most rudimentary principles of assessment  to evaluate all students using an instrument whose primary purpose is to rank test-takers against one another so that by definition everyone cant succeed.ALFIE KOHNBelmont, Mass.The writer is the author of The Case Against Standardized Testing.
