American Navy ships in the Arabian Sea intercepted and seized an arms shipment from Iran likely bound for Houthi rebels in Yemen, the military said in a statement on Monday. The weapons seized last week by the warships Sirocco and Gravely were hidden on a small dhow and included 1,500 AK-47 rifles, 200 rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and 21 .50-caliber machine guns, according to the Navy statement. The weapons were seized on March 28. The boat, which the Navy described as stateless, and its crew were released once the weapons were confiscated. The White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, said on Monday that Irans support for the Houthis in Yemens civil war was an example of its destabilizing activities in the region, and that the weapons shipment could be raised at the United Nations Security Council.
