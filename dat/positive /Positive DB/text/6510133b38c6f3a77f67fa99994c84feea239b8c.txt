To the Editor:Re Natural History, Endangered, by Richard Conniff (Sunday Review, April 3):Would natural history museums attract more interest and support if they were branded, say, natural world museums? There is nothing like natural history museum to evoke crusty, static old dioramas with former woolly mammoths eternally raising their trunks in frozen salute.Todays audiences, for better or worse, are married to interactivity, and the museum that leverages that desire for engagement will thrive. Just saying.SARAH TAMORSanta Monica, Calif.
