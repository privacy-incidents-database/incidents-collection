LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORETampa, Florida -- A data breach at a local hospital had nearly 700 patients' private information stolen.
It happened at Tampa General Hospital.The hospital takes responsibility and says it has fired an employee accused of printing off 675 "face sheets."Face sheets are like cover sheets, which include names, addresses, DOB's, and social security numbers.
The patients affected were those scheduled for surgeries between Oct. 3, 2011 and Aug. 7, 2014.The hospital says it educates its staff on the importance of patient information."It's kind of sickening when one of our own violates that trust," said John Dunn, TGH's spokesperson.
"We will do everything in our power to make sure people understand the importance."It was Tampa Police who alerted the hospital last month on August 14.
Officers arrested someone unrelated to the hospital, and that person had four of those face sheets with him.Some of the face sheets included social security numbers.
TGH launched its own investigation; through its software it tracked the unauthorized access.
Dunn said it invests in patient information security.
Each year, three outside agencies examine and test the security against these type of threats.The hospital has alerted each targeted patient.
They have also given one-year of free credit monitoring to those patients who had their social security number accessed. You can also call the dedicated call center at TGH with any questions if you believe you are affected, and have not received a letter by Sept. 30. The number is 1-877-202-4625 and is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.MORE:Notice for TGH patients regarding privacy incidentPatients who were affected may reach the Tampa Police Department at 813-354-6600.
