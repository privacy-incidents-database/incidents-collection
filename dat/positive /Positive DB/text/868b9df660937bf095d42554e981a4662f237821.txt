To the Editor:Re In Yeoman, Navy Finds Gender That Wont Bend (news article, April 5):Admin. That is the one-word answer to the Navys search for a simple, clear modern title to replace the Navys antiquated personnel term yeoman, for those who handle the Navys administrative and clerical tasks.Admin: Two crisp syllables like yeoman, same accent on the first, same min sound for the second, no gender reference, accurately describes the work, understandable for future employers, and same or similar term used in the civilian workplace.Admin reporting for duty!RICHARD SIMONForest Hills, QueensTo the Editor:The idea of seeking to change the title yeoman to avoid offending women (I am one) is taking a good idea (make language all-inclusive) to an absurd extreme.Its one thing to say we should change words that specifically imply that a man is doing this because the first part of the word stands by itself  policeman, fireman, mailman  or could end with woman. But is there such a thing as a yeo?If we eliminate every word that includes man in it, wed have to eliminate woman and human, too. And perhaps Manhattan.KAREN LEE WALDAlameda, Calif.
A version of this letter appears in print on April 8, 2016, on page A24 of the New York edition with the headline: Better Than Yeoman.
