A Restored Farmhouse on Two and a Half Acres in West Cork
A Restored Farmhouse on Two and a Half Acres in West Cork
A FOUR-BEDROOM RESTORED FARMHOUSE ON TWO AND A HALF ACRES IN WEST CORK$678,000 (595,000 EUROS)This 150-year-old farmhouse in coastal southwest Ireland, with four bedrooms and two and a half baths, was carefully renovated in the early 2000s to enhance its rustic charms. The 2,500-square-foot property, set on two and a half acres, is in western County Cork, a region informally called West Cork. Within a 10-minute drive of Skibbereen, a town of roughly 2,000 with ample shopping and dining, the house is about a mile from the sea. It is just over an hour from the international airport in Cork, said Sen Carmody, an agent with Charles McCarthy Estate Agents and Valuers, which has the listing.The main farmhouse, constructed from the traditional cement plaster over stone, is linked to the former milking parlor and pigsty by a wide, window-lined corridor that serves as both a living area and an entrance hall. The parlor and pigsty have been converted to a large kitchen and dining area, along with an adjoining studio/office with a separate entrance. All have underfloor heating. The house is being sold unfurnished, but individual pieces, such as the very large kitchen table, are negotiable.The kitchen is brightened by a skylight running lengthwise along a whitewashed vaulted ceiling. A striking elmwood arch frames a recessed AGA cast-iron stove. A stable-style door provides access to the private courtyard, which has raised flower beds and stone outbuildings.The living room has stained wooden floors and a wood-burning stove. Off the living room is a study with a fireplace flanked by floor-to-ceiling book shelves.All four bedrooms, on the second floor of the farmhouse, have vaulted ceilings. Three share the main bathroom, which has a separate shower cubicle.
The master bedroom has French doors leading to a private balcony, which affords distant views of Mount Gabriel and, on a very clear day, Roaringwater Bay, Mr. Carmody said. The master bath and dressing room are on the main floor, reached by way of a staircase. The bath has an open shower area, or wet room, and a heated towel rail.The surrounding grounds have mature gardens, stone walls, a paddock and a fruit enclosure that produces currants, blueberries and raspberries.While the nearby seaside villages in West Cork tend to be seasonal destinations, Skibbereen, on the River Ilen, has more of a year-round population, Mr. Carmody said. Something of a foodies paradise, it hosts a weekly farmers market, with locally raised organic meats, produce, and cheeses, as well as the annual Taste of West Cork Food Festival, to be held Sept. 9 to 18 this year. One of Irelands better-known chefs, Carmel Somers, recently moved her restaurant and cooking school, Good Things Cafe, to a prominent downtown property.The West Cork Arts Center opened a 10,000-square-foot exhibition space in the town center last year: called the Uillinn, it has a gallery, artists studios and a flexible performance space.The coastal areas closest to the house have coves, jetties and piers; big beaches are within 10 miles.MARKET OVERVIEWThe West Cork market began to rebound last year after an extended downturn that stretched from 2007 to 2014. At bottom, prices were off 60 percent from their peak, said Pat Maguire, the principal at Pat Maguire Properties, in Skibbereen. In 2015, as sales picked up, prices rose by about 10 percent to 15 percent. While they have leveled off some, Mr. Maguire predicted that values would likely climb another 5 percent this year.Irish buyers in West Cork are gravitating toward property in towns and villages, while non-Irish buyers tend to want more remote coastal properties, he said. Prices on and near the coast range from around 250,000 euros to upward of 1 million euros, or about $285,000 to $1.14 million.WHO BUYS IN WEST CORKBuyers from Britain are the main group driving the market at the moment. Their perception of the quality of life here is very good, Mr. Maguire said, citing as reasons West Corks laid-back atmosphere, milder climate relative to more northerly locations, easy access to Cork airport, and value, especially compared with much of the British market.
More foreign buyers are beginning to consider Ireland, Mr. Carmody noted. And West Corks simpler way of life, as it is still largely rural, appeals to harried professionals from Dublin and London, he said, adding, Its the charm that really sells it.Last year, for the first time in a long time, Mr. Maguire observed, Irish-Americans and Irish expatriates living in the United States began showing more interest in relocating to West Cork. American buyers are still scarce.BUYING BASICS Both the buyer and the seller typically hire a solicitor, a type of lawyer, to represent them, according to Liam ODonovan, a solicitor based in Skibbereen. Legal fees range from about 0.5 percent to 1 percent of the purchase price.The Irish government collects a stamp duty on all property transfers. The duty, paid by the buyer, is 1 percent of the purchase price up to a value of 1 million euros, or about $1.14 million, and 2 percent on any value above that.Foreign buyers must register with the Irish tax authorities and also obtain a Personal Public Service number. Property cannot be placed in their name until that has been done, Mr. ODonovan said.Both Mr. ODonovan and Mr. Maguire said foreign buyers might have a difficult time lining up sufficient financing with Irish banks. Its better for non-Irish buyers to have the funding organized on their own side, Mr. Maguire said.WEBSITESWest Cork Tourism: westcork.ieA Taste of West Cork Food Festival: atasteofwestcork.comLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYIrish, English; euro (1 euro = $1.14)TAXES AND FEESLocal property taxes on this home are approximately 1,035 euros, or about $1,180, annually, according to Mr. Carmody. In addition to stamp duty, land registry fees must be paid by the buyer; these range from 400 to 800 euros, or about $455 to $910, depending on the price of the property.CONTACTSen Carmody, Charles McCarthy Estate Agents and Valuers, (011 353) 86 166 0162; charlesmccarthy.com
