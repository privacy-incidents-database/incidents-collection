On the calendar, there are official days for cream puffs and science fiction, but rarely one that encourages exploration, whether at home or abroad, a gap that Obscura Day aims to fill.In its fifth year, the increasingly popular Obscura Day will take place on Saturday, April 16. Founded by the online media company Atlas Obscura, which covers obscure subjects and world wonders like the origins of ventriloquism and Cat Island in Japan, some 200 excursions in 35 states and 25 countries are planned for the event. (The New York Times Company is an investor in Atlas Obscura.)Our mission is to get people out experiencing a sense of adventure and exploration, said David Plotz, the chief executive of Atlas Obscura, which offers frequent outings that are multiplied and expanded globally on Obscura Day. The adventure, he said, can be mental, historical or physical. Its somewhere you havent been or will see in a new way.Events that celebrate Obscura Day include a beach party in an old mine in Kansas City reached only by boat, a tour of the self-proclaimed republic of Molossia in Nevada, urban foraging in Franklin Park in Boston, a bike tour of the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans, a visit to a former Soviet prison in Estonia and a trip to a subterranean temple in Italy.Many events take place in New York, including a garden party at a cemetery in the East Village, a Victorian banquet with period food and a tour of the Brooklyn Navy Yard.From a few hundred who participated in the original Obscura Day in 2010, the event drew 4,000 participants to 160 events last year. Admission to this years events range from free to $75, though most are in the $5 to $20 range.All these places we take for granted, if we even see them, are suddenly open on Obscura Day, said Leah Taylor, a New Yorker, summing up the events appeal. Last year, Ms.Taylor, 32, participated in her first Obscura Day by touring the Brooklyn Army Terminal. She called it the most fun Ive had on an educational field trip since middle school, she said.
