An English Country House With a Grand History of Horse Racing
The 11-bedroom house with gardens and Lutyens-style bench.
NEWMARKET, England  Overlooking Warren Hill Gallops and the open heath, where horses are trained daily in the celebrated British racing town of Newmarket, stands a house of notable architectural merit and great horse racing heritage.Mesnil Warren, which is on the market at 2.95 million pounds, or $4.2 million, was built in Newmarket, in the county of Suffolk, in the 1890s as a racing lodge and has been in the family of its current owner, George Lambton, since 1908.Mr. Lambton is the grandson of the Honorable George Lambton, a renowned thoroughbred racehorse trainer who was the fifth son of the second Earl of Durham and had a long career in the sport. As an amateur jockey he won the Grand Steeple-Chase de Paris in 1888, and working for Lord Derby he was the British flat racing champion trainer in 1906, 1911 and 1912. The story goes that a long time after buying Mesnil Warren he made a good bet on one of his horses, Sansovino, winning the Epsom Derby in 1924, and that with the money he made he decided to build a large extension, Mr. Lambton said. Whether this actually happened we really dont know, but what is true is that my grandmother, Cicely Lambton, knew the architect, Sir Edwin Lutyens, and so he was commissioned to design the new wing.Lutyens, who designed the Cenotaph war memorial in Londons Whitehall, as well as much of New Delhi, India, was also a prolific furniture designer, and in the United States is perhaps best known for his teak garden bench. For a time he was also at the heart of the Arts and Crafts movement in Britain, which brought an emphasis on the use of quality materials and decorative design at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.
The Lutyens wing was originally designed to provide extra guest bedrooms and further staff accommodation, Mr. Lambton said. It does sit well with the original building and has some interesting features of its own, such as plastered parts of external guttering, which look rather like interior cornicing.Mr. Lambtons grandfather died in 1945 and his wife, Cicely, continued to live at Mesnil Warren until 1972, when the 10,372-square-foot house was taken over by his son, Teddy Lambton, who was also a racehorse trainer.
I pretty much grew up here from the age of 10 and remember my parents completely refurbishing it in the 1970s. My father died in 1983; then when my mother died in 1996, my wife, Lisa, and I, who were living in London at the time, decided to move up here with our family, said Mr. Lambton, who is a former lord mayor of Newmarket and is now training to be a psychotherapist.It has been fun: We have enjoyed living somewhere that you can fill with family and friends and not even know they are there. The guest areas are all easy to maintain and to separate from the rest of the house if you wish to.Red brick-built Mesnil Warren sits in approximately two and a half acres of land and once included a stable yard. Today the grounds comprise areas of landscaped garden, as well as garaging and workshop areas, a tennis court and a summer house.The property has 11 bedrooms, as well as a self-contained two-bedroom apartment, across three stories of accommodation. The Lutyens wing, which was added to the north side of the house, has some typically Arts and Crafts features, including an upper floor under the roof and attractive dormer windows. The rest of the property retains its classic Victorian style.Four bedrooms, including the 414-square-foot master bedroom, which has its own bathroom and dressing room, are on the second floor of the original part of the building. Above, on the third floor, is the apartment, which has two bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen. There is also a sitting room of approximately 330 square feet, which opens onto a balcony.From here and from the master bedroom below you have the most amazing view out over the garden and on to the Gallops behind, where you can see the racehorses training every morning, Mr. Lambton said.
The dining room is graced with paintings of famous racehorses.
The ground floor of the newer part of the house includes the 393-square-foot kitchen breakfast room, as well as a study, family room and various storage and utility areas. A rear staircase leads up to two guest bedrooms and a second-floor drawing room of approximately 480 square feet, which has exterior steps down to the garden. On the third floor there are five more guest bedrooms and two bathrooms.
Among the most impressive rooms in the older part of the property is the grand drawing room of approximately 700 square feet. This has a high paneled ceiling, an elegant fireplace and an arch adorning a bay window. The 412-square-foot dining room is also a splendid space and, like the entrance hall to the house, is graced with paintings of some of the famous racehorses that were trained by Mr. Lambtons father and grandfather.While this house could suit all sorts of people, I expect that whoever buys it is likely to have more than a passing interest in racing, Mr. Lambton said. What they are buying into here is a part of the racing history of Newmarket.James Barnett, head of country residential at Savills Cambridge, the real estate agent marketing the property, described Newmarket as the home of English racing, but said it was also desirable for its proximity to Cambridge, about 13 miles away.Cambridge continues to grow and many new companies are moving to the city, including biotech, pharmaceutical and technology companies, such as AstraZeneca, Apple and Google, he said.Noting the array of available properties in both Cambridge and Newmarket, Mr. Barnett called this one exceptional, in part because it has a Lutyens- designed wing.Properties built or modified by Lutyens are highly prized, he said.
