Flash drive with employee data missing from Eastern Health office
Eastern Health has announced a USB flash drive is missing from its human resources department.
According to a statement released this morning, a USB flash drive containing a spreadsheet  with data on 9,000 employees  went missing from an office in the department June 26.
On behalf of Eastern Health, I want to publicly apologize to our employees whose personal information was on the missing flash drive, said David Diamond, EasternHealth president and CEO, according to the statement. We take all breaches of privacy very seriously and are committed to exploring ways to further strengthen our privacy practices surrounding safe security measures and the storage of information on portable devices.

The spreadsheet had the names, employee numbers and social insurance numbers of 3,300 employees, as well as names and employee numbers only of 5,700 more employees.
Eastern Health says the drive was last used June 17, two days before it was reported missing. An internal investigation has failed to turn up the drive, and the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner has been notified and has begun a formal investigation. Eastern Health says theres no evidence the information on the drive has been used for fraudulent purposes.
The health authority said it will start contacting by phone today the 3,300 employees whose social insurance numbers were on the spreadsheet, and send letters to the 5,700 other employees starting Monday. Eastern Health also said it will be providing information to employees to help protect themselves against identity theft.
