In Windows 7, go to the Start menu to Control Panel and click on User Accounts and Family Safety (or User Accounts). Click on Change your password and type in your old one, then type in the new password you want to use and confirm it. In the box below, type in the password hint you want to use. Click the Change Password button to change the password and store the hint.
In Mac OS X, go to the Apple menu and select System Preferences, or click on the gear-shaped System Preferences icon in the desktop Dock. Click on User Accounts (or Accounts) and the click the Change Password button.
Type in your old password, the new password (twice) and the hint word or phrase you want to use. Click the Change Password button.
When choosing a hint, make it an obscure reference that only you will connect with the actual password. The hints themselves may be visible in the systems registry or may appear on screen for someone sitting there trying to guess your password.
