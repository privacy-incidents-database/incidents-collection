permalinksavereportgive goldreply[]condraj2[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(8 children)Because I'm an idiot, I'm going to post what I wrote out for a text-based post:
I have no idea why this hasn't made the leap to English news/social media yet, but this is potentially big news. A recent submission to Wooyun (whitehat vulnerability platform) suggests that a large amount of users (potentially up to 500 million) of 126.com/163.com email accounts may have had their usernames, email addresses, hashed passwords, secret question/answers, registration IP addresses, and dates of birth, leaked due to a yet-to-be-disclosed vulnerability. Although NetEase issued a denial on Sina Weibo, CNCERT is apparently investigating.

tl;dr If you use NetEase services, change your password and enable two factor authentication, and consider detaching your NetEase account from third party services (Taobao, AliPay, Apple ID, etc.). Also if you reuse passwords across services, consider changing the duplicates as well.

I have no idea why this hasn't made the leap to English news/social media yet
For the same reason that a lot of "important" news doesn't make the leap into China. The netease hack isn't of interest to the general Anglosphere public. I'll bet you'll find it on almost every netsec website.
permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply[]HarRob 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(6 children)It will be in the Shenzhen Daily (English) tomorrow. Many iPhones users that linked their mailboxes with 163 were "hacked" according to the report.
permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply[]ratsta 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(3 children)Sure, but not many anglophones will be reading the SZ Daily. It's unlikely to be front-page on the WashPost, Sydney Herald etc. Just a point of interest in the tech section.
Were it Hotmail that got hacked, that'd be a different story!
permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply[]condraj2[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(2 children)The problem of course being that many American companies (banks, retailers, etc.) do business in China and thus have Chinese employees. The risk to their employees (and thus their company) here is significant, and who knows if they catch wind of such incidents if they're not written in English, especially considering security teams for such firms are primarily US-based.
permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply[]ratsta 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(1 child)I never said it was a good thing, just that unless the editors feel a news item is of interest to a newspaper's audience, the item won't hit the front page.
permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply[]condraj2[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(0 children)Agreed, and I didn't imply that you did said so.
permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply[]condraj2[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(1 child)My understanding here is that they either re-used their NetEase password with their AppleID or had them linked, as you suggested. In either case, attackers could log in and remotely lock ("brick" in many Chinese language reports) their phone. Sucks.
permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply[]HarRob 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(0 children)I understood they used Netease as a login
permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply[]Aan2007 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(0 children)yeah, only if i would be using Netease music app with registration
i just download what i want without any registration and listen in my favorite player, sorry Netease for exploiting you and not trusting you with my data
permalinksavereportgive goldreply[]TheDark1 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(0 children)That's Chinese users for you. WINDOWS XP FATALLY COMPROMISED! Nobody cares. iOS APPS COMPROMISED! Nobody cares. YOUR GODDAMN EMAIL DETAILS STOLEN! Nobody cares.
It must be so ridiculously easy for the government here to spy on everyone.
