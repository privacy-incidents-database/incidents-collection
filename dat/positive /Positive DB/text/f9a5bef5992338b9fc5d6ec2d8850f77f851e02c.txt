A United Nations Security Council vote on the toughest sanctions on North Korea in two decades was postponed until Wednesday at Russias request, the United States and France said Tuesday. The United States and China spent seven weeks negotiating the new sanctions, which include mandatory inspections of cargo ships leaving and entering North Korea, in response to the Norths latest nuclear test and rocket launching.

But Russia, which received the new draft on Thursday along with other Council members, asked for time to study the lengthy text and suggested changes.
A version of this brief appears in print on March 2, 2016, on page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: United Nations; Vote Is Set on North Korea Sanctions.
