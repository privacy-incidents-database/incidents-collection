response to a recent wave of cyberattacks that hit two dozen important Web sites in the United States and South Korea, we are already in the Brave New World of cyberwarfare.After all, what could be more disturbing than to find that someone

marked by the steep rise of open-source software developed and tested by large and open communities,
have taught us anything about security, it is that excessive secrecy is usually not the best way to secure ones networks.There is a reason why open-source operating systems based on Linux are less likely to be infected by a virus than proprietary systems like Microsofts Windows: As computer security experts like to say, given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.The problem with the current approach to cybersecurity is that by miring it in unnecessary secrecy, we are shrinking,
and fix those bugs.Much of the real computer talent today is concentrated in
the private sector. The only two countries that have successfully found ways to involve their private sectors in cybersecurity
are also the ones commonly accused of being on the cyberoffensive, undoubtedly a very exciting proposition for their patriotic hackers.
To inject more talent into government IT jobs, it is necessary to raise their visibility and prestige, perhaps by creating national Tech Corps
