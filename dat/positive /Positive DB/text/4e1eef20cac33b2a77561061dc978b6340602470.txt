SEATTLE, Oct. 4 (AP)  In its forthcoming Windows Vista product,
will take much harsher steps to curtail piracy than in previous versions of its operating system, including crippling the usefulness of computers found to be running unlicensed copies of the new software.
Microsoft, the worlds largest software maker, said Wednesday that people running a version of Windows Vista that it thought was pirated would initially be denied access to some
Vista features. That includes Windows Aero, an improved graphics technology.If a legitimate copy is not purchased within 30 days, the system will curtail functionality much further by restricting users to just the Web browser for an hour at a time, said Thomas Lindeman, Microsoft senior product manager.In that situation, a person could use the browser to surf the Web, gain access to documents on the hard drive or log onto Web-based e-mail. But the user would not be able to
open documents directly from the computer desktop or run other programs like Outlook e-mail software, Mr. Lindeman said.Microsoft said that it would not stop a computer running pirated Vista software from working completely and that it would continue to deliver critical security updates.The company
said it had added more sophisticated technology for monitoring whether a system is pirated. Microsoft plans to take similar tough measures with the forthcoming version of its Windows server software, called Longhorn, and to incorporate it into other products.
