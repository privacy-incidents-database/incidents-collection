Gabriel Mascaro: Ebbs and Flows, a Young Directors Views of Brazil
A scene from High-Rise, Gabriel Mascaros documentary about class.
Play and hard work among working-class people living close to nature is a dominant theme for the Brazilian filmmaker Gabriel Mascaro, whose second fictional feature, Neon Bull, a study of the rugged lives of Brazilian rodeo riders, opened on April 8. That sensual film, which shows couples making love outdoors among cattle, typifies the work of this documentarian turned feature film director, who is having a retrospective, Gabriel Mascaro: Ebbs and Flows, at the Walter Reade Theater in Lincoln Center, from April 15 through 19. It includes his 2014 film, August Winds, whose central love affair between a city girl and a country boy takes place on a coconut farm in coastal Brazil during stormy weather. For the documentary Housemaids, Mr. Mascaro gave seven teenagers cameras to film their live-in maids for a week. In High-Rise, he interviews residents of a modern building about class, privilege and inequality. This compassionate, socially conscious filmmaker is a major emerging talent. (filmlinc.org.)
