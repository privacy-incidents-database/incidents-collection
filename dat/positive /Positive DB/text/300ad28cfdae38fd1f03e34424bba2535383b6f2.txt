The artist William Wegman lives and works in a fortresslike building in Chelsea. His two Weimaraners, Flo and Topper, are not only pets but frequent subjects of his work. These two are really good at being up on things rather than lying flat on things, he said, which my other dogs were really great at.
The 72-year-old artist and author opens up his favorite room, the Manhattan studio where he created some of his well-known dog portraits.
