To the Editor:Re Winston Moseley, Unsparing Killer of Kitty Genovese, Dies in Prison at 81 (obituary, April 5):With Winston Moseleys death comes, maybe, the final chapter in the tragic story of the events of the early morning of Friday, March 13, 1964.As my mother would have wished, my familys better angels do now express our condolences to the Moseley family, most especially to the Rev. Steven Moseley, one of Winstons sons, a man of faith, love and courage who struggled in his formative years with a stain and dilemma undeservedly forced onto his being.May the Spirit, in whom I believe that Kitty, and now Winston, reside, help resolve the eternal question: What do we owe to all our fellow beings? This is a question that each human being must strive to answer, one moment at a time. Let us join with the hope of shared egalitarian equanimity.
A version of this letter appears in print on April 8, 2016, on page A24 of the New York edition with the headline: From Kitty Genoveses Brother: The Final Chapter.
