Human error leads to second privacy breach on Vermont Health ConnectDec. 17, 2013, 11:11 am by Alicia Freese 7 Comments For the second time in two months, a user of the Vermont Health Connect website gained access to someone elses personal information.Mark Larson, commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access, told lawmakers the incident, which occurred Friday, was caused by human error.Larson  who was publicly reprimanded by Gov. Peter Shumlin and House Speaker Shap Smith for failing to disclose the previous breach  shared the news during a House Health Care Oversight meeting Tuesday.The incident, according to Larson, was limited to two individuals with the same first and last names, and it was the result of a human error, not an issue with technology or hacking.Larson described the event as a privacy incident, emphasizing that it did not constitute a security breach because no one broke into the system.What happened, according to Larson, is that one user called a customer service representative to make a change to their application. The representative accidentally attached another users personal information to this callers account in the process of documenting their request.The caller later noticed that another persons information had been included in their account. They immediately notified the department, and DVHA reported the incident to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Saturday. According to the incident report, the caller was able to view the other customers address, email and phone number and when individual clicked on my applications they were able to view the other Individuals summary of benefits page.The first incident, on Oct. 17, involved two participants who registered with the same user name.Asked whether he could assure Vermonters that a similar event wont occur in future, Larson said: Well do a review of all of our procedures to see if there are more steps that we can take. It is unique to have two people with the exact same name.Larson didnt waste time letting lawmakers know  he sent a memo Monday, describing the incident and assuring them it was an isolated occasion. The three-paragraph briefing concludes, In responding to this incident, all privacy protocols were followed. VHC has reported the incident to CMS and has communicated with both individuals involved. VHC is also making every effort to ensure that the Customer Support Center procedures are sufficiently detailed and VHC workers are adequately trained to avoid any such incidents in the future.The sole question from lawmakers Tuesday came from Sen. Sally Fox, D-Chittenden, who wanted to know whether Vermont Health Connect users have to provide information, in addition to their names, to verify their identity on the phone. People are required to answer security questions, Larson said. The incident occurred after the questions were asked.We are not raising it because we feel there is a risk to other Vermont Health Connect users, Larson told the committee.House Minority Leader Don Turner, R-Milton, wasnt appeased by Larsons reassurances.I absolutely have concerns, Turner said Tuesday. This is the second time one of these isolated security breaches have occurred, and we are getting the same story a second time  that it wont happen again, that its a minor event.Turner also contested Larsons statement, which indicated that its rare for two people to share the same name.Theres another guy in Jericho with the same name as mine, Turner said. Look in the phone book under Smith.Larson deferred to Department of Information and Innovation (DII) Commissioner Richard Boes to describe what the state is doing to shield Vermont Health Connect from security breaches.We are going through a very thorough review process of all of CGIs security, Boes assured the committee.While Larson has been a frequent guest at health care committee meetings, some members of the Oversight Committee were unclear about the role DII plays in overseeing the exchange.DIIs responsibilities arent written into the states contract with CGI, but state law requires the department to oversee IT projects, and theyve been involved since the beginning, Boes explained. One person, in particular, the Chief Information Security Officer, Nick Waringa, is charged with monitoring the security of all state systems.Part of the states contract calls for a security audit to be carried out by a third party. That audit is complete and was submitted to DII on Monday, but it wont be released to the public because it contains sensitive security information, Boes said.According to Boes, the report hasnt uncovered anything alarming  There are multiple findings in this report but many are about dotting Is and crossing Ts.The contract requires CGI to respond to the findings with a plan of action for each item, and CMS mandates that high risk issues be addressed by Jan. 31.The audit findings arent identified by priority level, and DII has just begun sifting through the report.There may be more serious audit items in there, but until we do a thorough analysis of that report, we do not have prioritization of those items, Boes added.Editors note: This article was updated at 5:19 p.m.

After having a checking account for more than 60 years and never finding a bank error it just happened. I reported it to the bank. They made the correction and said that someone just pushed to wrong button and the same check was deducted twice from my account. I wonder why the computer program did not pick that up same check #, same amount, same date and the computer did not red flag that?0
| Reply Hide Replies Doug Spaulding2 years 3 months agoI can maybe see the bank making that 1 error in over 60 years but we are looking at 2 very serious errors in less than 3 months. Larson, once again, does not feel that there is a risk to users of VHC but he certainly is not establishing much, if any, of a comfort zone for subscribers to this program. And it is not at all unique for two people to have the exact same name, even in our very small state.0
| Reply Hide Replies Stan Hopson2 years 3 months agoSame names maybe, but isnt that what DOB, SSN, Address, etc are for?After all, if I call Citizens Bank and say this is Shappy Smith, doesnt the bank ask me what kind of name is Shappy?0
| Reply Hide Replies Martha Lang2 years 3 months agoBetter yet is VT Health Connect can cash any check you send to them. For example if by mistake you put your mortgage payment check in the envelope to VHC they can cash it and NOT refund the money. How about that for a kicker?0
| Reply Hide Replies Josh Fitzhugh2 years 3 months agoHighly unlikely that security audit would not prioritize areas where more security is needed. State auditor or legislative oversight committee should insist on seeing audit results.0
| Reply Hide Replies Kathy Callaghan2 years 3 months agoAgree with Josh. Its way past time there was meaningful, responsible active oversight on Vermont Health Connect. So far there has not been. This should be conducted by an independent entity answerable to the voters not to the administration.With a Democratic nearly super-majority, we have not seen Democrats willing to challenge either Shumlin or Larson. It is their responsibility to represent their constituents, not to go along with the crowd.0
| Reply Hide Replies Ron Pulcer2 years 3 months agoThe two incidents thus far have been similar, whereby VHC users/customers have similar or same names or account names. While these incidents can fall into the category of a security problem or breach, it sounds to me more like a system design flaw or lack of testing edge conditions like same first and last names. This weeks reports of the hack of 40 million customers data at the Target department store chain (in the private sector) is a much more serious problem. The Target hacking incidents are an actual security breach (multiple incidents at multiple stores), as opposed to aRead more 0
