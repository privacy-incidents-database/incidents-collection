To the Editor:I enjoyed Bob Morriss surreal password control questions (How Insecure Is Your Password?, Sunday Review, Jan. 5), but he doesnt exaggerate much. Here are actual security questions Ive encountered:What is your favorite color? I dont think the problem is that Im an artist. Im sure that many people like various colors, depending on where they see them or wear them, and certainly cant choose an all-time favorite.What is your favorite food to eat?Who, besides a panda or a koala, has one favorite food? Imagine how ridiculous that appears to a New York City foodie. And is there another kind of food except food to eat?What is your favorite holiday?Who, older than 12, has a favorite holiday?What is your favorite movie?
Movie? Are we talking all-time Hollywood, European, recent favorite or indie? I couldnt even pick a favorite Kurosawa.What is your favorite sport?Favorite sport? Do you mean to play or to watch? Summer or winter? Cant I have two favorites? Unless Im a professional in one of them, chances are that my sports life isnt that simple.So Mr. Morris was deliciously on target, but Im sure that everyone can rhapsodize on his theme  from mind-numbing experience, not imagination.CURT BARNES
