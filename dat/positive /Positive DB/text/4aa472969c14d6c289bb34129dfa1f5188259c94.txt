Social Security numbers, birthdates and other information of about 3.5 million residents have been accidentally posted on computer servers, the state comptroller, Susan Combs, said Monday. Most of the information, including some drivers license numbers, was available for more than a year. Ms. Combs said the information included data transferred by the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, the Texas Workforce Commission and the Employees Retirement System of Texas. She said that there was no indication any information was misused.
A version of this brief appears in print on April 12, 2011, on page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: Texas: Personal Data Posted Accidentally.
