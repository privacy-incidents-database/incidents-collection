Composed of simple materials  steel, hand-drawn ink on parchment, a burning candle  Yael Kanareks Feedback-Loop might not seem to be the work of a new-media artist. But Ms. Kanarek has spent the last 20 years moving between digital and analog, virtual and real. Starting Tuesday, the Lower East Side gallery Bitforms will host Kisses Kisses, Ms. Kanareks fifth show there, which looks back at her career exploring life in the information age.The show includes Feedback-Loop and World of Awe, a multimedia narrative on the web that Ms. Kanarek has been working on for more than a decade, chronicling the journey of a lone traveler who crosses through a portal on Manhattans East Sixth Street into a virtual desert, searching for lost treasure. Kisses Kisses will feature paintings and ephemera by Ms. Kanarek that have never been seen before. (212-366-6939, bitforms.com.)
