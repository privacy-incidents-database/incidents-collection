An Alert System for Security Breaches - The New York Times
Hackers breached LinkedIn, LastFM.com, eHarmony, Yahoo and other sites, then posted customers usernames, passwords, e-mail addresses and device IDs to the Internet for all to see. In most cases, the consumers had to dig through hackers data dumps to find out what, if any, of their information had been compromised, then scurry to change their log-in credentials across many sites.
Now, with breaches on the rise, some companies have started offering customers new services to save them the trouble. LastPass, a service for managing passwords, said on Tuesday that it had partnered withPwnedList, a database of leaked usernames and passwords, to alert customers if a Web site was breached and if their information was included in the data dump.
The company will perform daily scans of PwnedLists database of 24 million (and growing) publicly leaked usernames and passwords and alert customers by e-mail if a domain was breached, if their log-in information was compromised and if they used the same password for the breached Web site elsewhere.In a blog post, LastPass said it planned to offer its alert system, called LastPass Sentry, free.
A similar service for potentially more sensitive information  like credit card and Social Security numbers  is available through AllClearID, an identity protection service. This year, AllClearID debuted a free mobile app for the iPhone and iPad that alerts consumers if their credit cards or Social Security numbers have been stolen or if thieves are using their childs identity.
AllClearID pulls that information from the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance, an organization that partners with law enforcement agencies and companies like PayPal and Microsoft as a repository for stolen consumer information.Any time these agencies or companies encounter stolen credentials, they send them to the alliance. Until this year, the alliance reported any stolen credentials to the companies that had issued them.
The AllClear ID mobile app and LassPass service mark the first time consumers will be alerted directly.
