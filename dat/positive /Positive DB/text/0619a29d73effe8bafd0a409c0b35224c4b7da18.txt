New Financial Investment Rules May Aid Robo Advisers
Washingtons new rules for financial advisers may give so-called robo advisers a leg up in the battle for investor dollars.The new rules, announced on Wednesday, are expected to encourage a rush of retirement savings money to low-cost investments, something the robo advisers claim as their hallmark.The rules may also hasten formal match-ups between traditional banks and brokerage firms and the financial technology firms that have built robo-investing platforms.On Thursday, the robo-firm SigFig Wealth Management, which is based in San Francisco, will announce what it says will be its first agreement with a bank to offer its digital investment service to the banks customers.

Bank of Americas Merrill Lynch is expected to introduce an offering in the coming months, and executives from Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo have talked about developing or acquiring the capability.In a twist, last year, JPMorgan Chase said it would offer retail investors a chance to buy into initial public offerings of stock on which it acts as lead adviser through the digital brokerage firm Motif Investing, for as little as $250 an order. The way Wall Street typically works, access to a banks I.P.O. deals is restricted to the wealthiest or best customers.Cambridge Savings Bank is calling its SigFig offering Connect Invest. It is available for bank customers with a minimum of $2,000 to invest. Continue reading the main story
