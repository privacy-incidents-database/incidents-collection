UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations Security Council ordered the assets of two Libyan banks that had been under the control of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to be unfrozen on Friday, clearing the way for the return of more than $40 billion to help the new government rebuild the country. The transitional government had asked the Council's sanctions committee to lift the asset freeze on the Central Bank of Libya and its subsidiary, the Libyan Foreign Bank. There were no objections from any of the 15 Council nations who make up the committee by the deadline on Friday evening, so the sanctions were immediately lifted.
The Security Council on Tuesday condemned for the first time sexual abuse among peacekeepers after being told that United Nations members ignored such exploitation for decades, fearing exposure of their own soldiers' wrongdoing. The United Nations has accused peacekeepers and civilian staff in Congo of rape and pedophilia, and enticing hungry children with food or money in exchange for sex. Sexual abuse on a smaller scale was discovered in other missions.
World Briefing | Middle East: Iran: Europeans Plan Tough Report
France, Germany and Britain are preparing a toughly worded resolution criticizing Iran for concealing sensitive nuclear technology for decades from the United Nations nuclear watchdog, diplomats said. But the countries would stop short of reporting the failures to the Security Council for possible sanctions. The International Atomic Energy Agency's board is to meet Thursday, and the United States wants the board to refer Iran to the Security Council. A Western diplomat told Reuters on condition of anonymity that European, Latin American and most board members from the nonaligned movement had ''a more or less common opinion'' against reporting Iran to the Council and that most board members favored a ''strongly worded resolution that sends a very strong message'' to Iran. It was unclear whether such a resolution would be enough to satisfy the United States and two allies taking a similarly tough line, Canada and Australia.
World Briefing | United Nations: Security Council Rotates
The 15-nation Security Council takes on five new non-veto-bearing members today and bids farewell to five that are ending two-year terms. Germany, Spain, Pakistan, Chile and Angola took seats on the Council just after midnight. They join the five permanent members -- the United States, France, Russia, Britain and China -- and five other nations with one year remaining of their two-year terms: Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and Syria. The five newest members were elected by a vote of the 191-nation General Assembly in September. They fill seats vacated at midnight by Colombia, Ireland, Mauritius, Norway and Singapore.

World Briefing | Middle East: Iraq: U.N. Approves Sanctions Plan
The United Nations Security Council voted 15 to 0 in favor of an American-Russian compromise resolution that promises to revise sanctions against Iraq within six months and extends the ''oil for food'' program. Under the deal, Russia agreed to approve by May 30 a new list of goods that would need United Nations review before shipment to Iraq. The United States, in turn, agreed to Russia's demand for a settlement of the sanctions issue, including steps that would lead to lifting the embargo, providing Iraq allows United Nations weapons inspectors to resume their work.
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina of Cuba met for about 30 minutes today with the chief United Nations delegate from the United States, Bill Richardson, and an American official said that terrorism was one of the issues discussed. Although it was the highest level meeting in some years between diplomats of the two estranged countries, Mr. Richardson was acting solely in his capacity as president of the Security Council for September. Mr. Robaina is at the United Nations to attend the General Assembly, which he is due to address on Wednesday.
Security Council members expressed concern today about the safety of the United Nations human rights staff members in Cambodia. The Council president, Sir John Weston of Britain, alluded to a recent statement by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, Cambodia's strongman, calling on the United Nations to replace its human rights workers and to apologize for reporting that dozens of people had been killed in the coup in July that gave Mr. Hun Sen broad powers. ''We are also particularly concerned about the personal security of those who are serving in the U.N. human rights center in Cambodia,'' Sir John said.
U.N. Bosnia Commander Wants More Troops, Fewer Resolutions
The United Nations commander in Bosnia says the Security Council and European Community should spend less time passing resolutions on the former Yugoslav republic and concentrate instead on sending enough peacekeeping troops. "I don't read the Security Council resolutions any more because they don't help me," Lieut. Gen. Francis Briquemont of Belgium, commander of the United Nations Protection Force in Bosnia, said in an interview on Wednesday. "There is a fantastic gap between the resolutions of the Security Council, the will to execute those resolutions and the means available to commanders in the field."
Iraq ridiculed President Bush and condemned the United Nations Security Council today as President Saddam Hussein's Government intensified its criticism of international sanctions. Alluding to Mr. Bush's efforts in behalf of American automakers on his recent trip to Japan, a spokesman for the Iraqi Culture and Information Ministry said Mr. Bush should "concentrate his efforts on succeeding in his new job as a salesman of cars" and stay out of Iraqi affairs, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
