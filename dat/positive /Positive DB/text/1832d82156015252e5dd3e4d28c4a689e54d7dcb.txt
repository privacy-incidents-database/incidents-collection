THE RENTERS Laura Allibone and Rodion Kulichenko, with Koshka, at home on the Upper East Side.
In Washington, D.C., Laura Allibone and Rodion Kulichenko shared a one-bedroom rental for just under $2,000 a month.Their Woodley Park apartment was large, charming and sunny. It did, however, have a noise problem. We tried not to talk in the kitchen, Ms. Allibone said. If they did, the upstairs neighbor heard every word. Apparently, a kitchen pipe funneled noise upward. We couldnt really eat at the table, she said.The couple, who met as students working at a Ruby Tuesday, wanted to move to New York. It was easy for Mr. Kulichenko, 29, a graduate of George Mason University, to transfer to the Midtown office of his accounting firm. Ms. Allibone, 27, a graduate of American University who works in health care technology, landed a new job in SoHo.They were perfectly happy to forgo amenities. For a one-bedroom apartment that was sunny, cat-friendly and big enough for two, they thought a monthly budget of $2,200 to $2,500 would suffice.
Mr. Kulichenkos employer sent him out of town for a few weeks, so Ms. Allibone went on the hunt without him, staying with friends or her older sister, who lives on the Upper East Side.Honestly, I trusted her, Mr. Kulichenko said. He was grateful, too, that Ms. Allibone was assuming the burden of the hunt.
MANHATTAN On East 87th Street, a one-bedroom was appealing except that A., it was tiny, and B., it was on the ground floor.
Friends of Ms. Allibones sister led her to Erica Geller, a saleswoman then at Bond New York and now at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, who arranged to show her some small walk-up buildings on the Upper East Side.On East 87th Street, a one-bedroom for $2,150 a month was nicely finished, but coming from the D.C. market, you forget how small things actually can get, Ms. Allibone said. It felt like a dollhouse. It was really tiny, not just floor plan-wise  the ceiling was really low.She wished she could reallocate space from the relatively big bathroom to the bedroom. Whats more, the apartment was on the ground floor. She thought passers-by would peer through the window.That apartment showed what the low end of the budget would buy, Ms. Geller said. On East 89th Street, the women visited a slightly larger place for $2,375 a month.As they walked around, there was a knock on the door. The downstairs neighbor appeared, sternly requesting a stop to the stomping. Ms. Allibone was wearing boots, but we werent stomping, she said.The complaint instantly turned her against the place. She had already dealt with a sensitive neighbor and bad building acoustics. I dont want to bother my neighbors or have to deal with being silent in my apartment, either, she said.
One block away, for $2,350 a month, was a one-bedroom, relatively large though with a small bathroom.
MANHATTAN At first it seemed as if a one-bedroom on East 73rd was O.K. Upon reflection, O.K. wasnt good enough.
Ms. Allibone loved it. I was in there for two minutes before I was planning where I was going to put things, she said. She asked about noise; the departing tenants, who had bought a place nearby, said they had received no complaints.Ms. Allibone applied immediately, but was unprepared to find a place so quickly, for she still needed to gather some of the required documentation, including not just pay stubs and bank statements but  to her disbelief  the first two pages of the couples federal tax returns. Then word came that someone had beaten her to it. My heart sank, she said.A few days later, she saw a one-bedroom on East 73rd Street for $2,250 a month. Ms. Geller negotiated the rent to $2,200.It was O.K., Ms. Allibone said. It fit enough criteria. She figured she should rent it before I lose out on more.But a problem arose with her rental history, which puzzled her. It turned out to be a mistake, involving the sale of a management company she had rented from years before. The ensuing delay gave her time to reconsider, and she decided to wait for something she liked better, even if it cost more.I want to go somewhere that we are really happy, she thought, and that we are going to make our home for a while.She found the hunt surprisingly time-consuming, with plenty of traveling to visit apartments and bag-schlepping as she shuttled among friends.
MANHATTAN A railroad apartment in a walk-up on First Avenue in the 80s had a refreshing amount of elbow room.
She made a brief foray to Midtown East, which was closer to work. But the neighborhood felt a little business-y, she said. I started to get pickier. If I was going to do this, I wanted to do it right.
When she saw a fourth-floor apartment in a walk-up on First Avenue in the East 80s, I couldnt get over it, she said. It was so much more than I thought I would get.The railroad apartment had three large rooms separated by pocket doors. The space seemed a little strange, but I liked the fact that it was there, she said.The rent, $2,550 a month, was on the high side, but Ms. Geller negotiated the rent to $2,500 a month in exchange for an immediate move-in date. The couple arrived in late fall, paying a broker fee of 15 percent of a years rent, or $4,500.Mr. Kulichenko was pleased with their new home. At more than 700 square feet, it was larger than the Washington apartment. I thought maybe the railroad style was a little bit weird, he said, but other people have more convoluted setups.Its so big that they sometimes wonder where the two cats are. It sounds like I am complain-bragging, because we had to get more furniture, Ms. Allibone said. They hear no neighbor noise, only traffic.The couple dont have the elevator, the trash chute or the laundry room that they did in Washington. Daily chores like toting groceries up steep stairs to a high floor and trash down to a vestibule make for a completely different way of life, she said.I wasnt necessarily thinking about all of those things when I said that a walk-up was the way to go.
