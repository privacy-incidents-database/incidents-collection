It sounds like the summer sequel to a techno-horror film: The Veterans Affairs Department
has lost yet another computer filled with data that identity thieves would pay handsomely to rifle. The first missing computer, a laptop that a V.A. worker blithely took home, had information on millions of veterans and active soldiers. After an anxious six-week search, it was recovered last month, supposedly uncompromised. Two teenagers were charged with taking it from the V.A. workers home.
V.A. Secretary Jim Nicholson, abashed at not being told of the theft for two weeks, apologized
and vowed that his agency would set the gold standard for securing vital government records. Fools gold, so far. The latest V.A. data trove reported at large is a desktop computer that somehow disappeared from a subcontractors supposedly secure area, leaving an estimated 38,000 medical patients at risk in Pennsylvania. There have been at least two other cases of lost V.A. data involving 16,000 people in Indianapolis and Minneapolis. All this is no surprise to the agencys inspector general, who has written four years of audits warning that V.A. data security is riddled with uncorrected problems.The harrowing mishaps are doubly alarming for raising questions about the state of computer security across the rest of the federal bureaucracy. Congressional outrage will prove useless unless far firmer safeguards are demanded  from mandatory encryption of identity information to physical security for computer outlets. Critics demand for management change at Veterans Affairs is hardly the full solution for such a pernicious and potentially far more widespread problem.
