In a world of very few absolutes, here is one: Nature has no more perfect offering than fruit, nothing that seems better engineered to delight and entice humankinds every sense. But of course, the real purpose of fruit is not to make humans happy, but to make more fruit: While it is the result of a relentless biological process that we happen to enjoy, the creation of fruit itself  from its larval stage (if you will) as a flower to its dropping from the tree or bush onto the ground and growing into a new tree or bush  would go on whether we were there to appreciate it or not.But lets pretend for a moment that, really, fruits only purpose is to give us pleasure. There is the pleasure of touching it (the bristly, terrier-like skin of a kiwi; the Arthurian-legend-worthy, dragonlike scales of the heart-shaped cherimoya), of looking at it (what is lovelier than a late-summer watermelon cracked in two, red as a secret) and, especially, of tasting it: All fruit may not be equally sweet, but all of it is consistently sweet, which means that consuming it is guaranteed to be, at the very worst, a semi-gratifying sensation and, at the very best, ecstasy-inducing. It is probably the only thing in life that provides such reliable happiness, however momentary.Knowing this, its perhaps no surprise that we have been creating hybrid fruits  sweeter, prettier, more gratifying children of two already sweet, pretty and gratifying parents  for as long as history has been recorded. And its perhaps even less of a surprise that our more-more-more age has also become a golden era of fruit diversity. There is the mandarinquat, an offspring of the mandarin and kumquat, a faintly nipple-shaped, smooth-skinned blob thats at once terrifically juicy and eye-wateringly, addictively tart; the pink variegated lemon, a deceptively normal-looking citrus that, once sliced open, reveals a rosy center; the baby kiwi, shrunk to grape size and denuded of hair, perfect for popping, whole, into the mouth; and the purple-fleshed dragon fruit, its flavor indistinguishable from its more familiar white-fleshed cousin, and bred exclusively for its looks.Looking at these mutants, the drearier among us might try to wade into a discussion of GMOs and Frankenstein produce. But to do so would be to miss what every child, every Renaissance painter and, yes, everyone whos ever craved a little more sweetness in her life already inherently understands: Deliciousness is to be celebrated, in whatever form it comes, and however unexpected.Below, a visual guide to specialty fruits.

An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a biological stage of development. The larval stage applies to the animal kingdom, not to plants. The article also described several fruits incorrectly. The pink variegated lemon, the baby kiwi, and the purple-fleshed dragon fruit are specialty fruits  not hybrids. The headline also referred incorrectly to the fruits. They are specialty fruits, not new manmade fruits. That error was repeated in a reference to several other fruits in an accompanying visual guide.
A version of this article appears in print on April 17, 2016, on page M2120 of T Magazine with the headline: Strange Fruits.
