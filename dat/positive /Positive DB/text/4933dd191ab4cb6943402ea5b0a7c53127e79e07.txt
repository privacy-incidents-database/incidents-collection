The Vatican computer expert accused of helping Pope Benedict XVIs former butler of stealing the popes confidential papers had no reason to risk his career to help the butler because he did not know him well, his lawyer argued on Monday in the opening hearing of the second trial related to a security breach at the Vatican. The popes former butler, Paolo Gabriele, was convicted of leaking the stolen documents to the news media. The computer expert, Claudio Sciarpelletti, 48, is charged with helping Mr. Gabriele by giving wavering and contradictory answers to the authorities about a closed envelope addressed personally to Mr. Gabriele and containing material that was found in his desk, the indictment read. Mr. Sciarpellettis lawyer explained his clients contradictory statements as a reflection of his confused emotional state. The trial was adjourned until Saturday.
A version of this brief appears in print on November 6, 2012, on page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: The Vatican: Leaks Trial, Part II.
