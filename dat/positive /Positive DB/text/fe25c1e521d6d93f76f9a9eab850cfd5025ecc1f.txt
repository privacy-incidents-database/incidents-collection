American Tech Giants Face Fight in Europe Over Encrypted Data
A man taking pictures on the Champs-lyses in Paris. Recent terrorist attacks have pushed many Europeans to favor greater powers for law enforcement over digital privacy.
ROME  Silicon Valleys battle over encryption is heading to Europe.In the United States, the F.B.I.s demands that Apple help unlock an iPhone used by a mass killer in California opened a heated debate on privacy. After recent attacks on the Continent, like the bombings in Brussels last week and the wave of violence in Paris last November, governments across the European Union are increasingly pushing for greater access to peoples digital lives.This week, French lawmakers are expected to debate proposals to toughen laws, giving intelligence services greater power to get access to personal data.The battle has pitted Europes fears about the potential for further attacks against concerns from Apple and other American technology giants like Google and Facebook that weakening encryption technologies may create so-called back doors to peoples digital information that could be misused by European law enforcement officials, or even intelligence agencies of unfriendly countries.The recent attacks have pushed many Europeans to favor greater powers for law enforcement over privacy. But opponents say such measures should not undermine the regions tough data protection rules that enshrine privacy on par with other rights like freedom of expression.This balance between national security and privacy has put major countries in the region on opposite sides of the debate, with Germany and the Netherlands dismissing encryption laws being considered by Britain and France.
Fundamental rights are just that, fundamental, said Nico van Eijk, a data protection expert at the University of Amsterdam. Of course, there are exceptions for national security reasons. But governments have to be pragmatic.That pragmatism has led to a series of new proposals across Europe that, if approved, would give national intelligence agencies renewed powers to compel the likes of Apple, Google and Facebook to hand over encrypted information.

In Britain, lawmakers are completing legislation that could force tech companies to bypass encryption protections in the name of national security. The law  called a snoopers charter by opponents  may compel companies to aid the countrys law enforcement agencies by hacking peoples smartphones and computers, among other powers.And on Tuesday, French politicians will debate proposals to update antiterrorism laws that may hand tech executives prison sentences of up to five years, as well as fine their companies around $390,000, if they refuse to provide encrypted information to the countrys investigators.Amendments to the French law  itself a response to the attacks in November  may still pass without the encryption proposals, which are opposed by Frances left-wing government.But politicians and industry executives say Apples fight with the F.B.I. has focused a spotlight on how companies efforts to protect users messages and other data have made it increasingly difficult for European intelligence agencies to obtain such information.When were able to recover a cellphone, but authorities have no way of accessing its data, it obviously cripples the work of our surveillance agencies, said Philippe Goujon, a French politician behind the recent encryption proposals.Sure, this could have repercussions internationally, he added. But there are other countries in the world that have similar legislation.
How Europe Protects Your Online Data Differently Than the U.S.
All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.
Europes attempts to get access to encrypted data have not gone unchallenged by Apple.Timothy D. Cook, Apples chief executive, has, for instance, met with a string of European politicians, including Frances prime minister, Manuel Valls, and Britains home secretary, Theresa May, in recent months to lobby for tough encryption technology.
And to show that the company is trying to be cooperative, Apples executives have also provided unencrypted information, including so-called metadata on peoples phone calls and GPS coordinates, as part of terrorism investigations in Europe, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.Such efforts, in part, have paid off with some European governments that remain skeptical of plans to weaken companies encryption technology in the name of national security.Germany, which has some of the worlds toughest privacy rules, has balked at the proposals Britain and France are considering, while the Dutch government published an open letter this year expressly stating its opposition to back doors in encryption services provided by the likes of Apple.Such loopholes, the Dutch government said, would also make encrypted files vulnerable to criminals, terrorists and foreign intelligence services.As pressure in parts of Europe mounts over access to encrypted data, industry watchers say attention is expected to focus on Britain  a top international market for most American tech companies  where expanded powers for the countrys intelligence services are likely to come into force by the end of the year. The legislation is the brainchild of the ruling Conservative Party, which has a sufficient parliamentary majority to enact the regulatory changes.Under the proposals, the Investigatory Powers Bill would force Internet and telecommunications companies to hold records of websites visited by people in Britain over the last 12 months. It also would provide the countrys intelligence agencies with a legal mandate for the bulk collection of large quantities of data, while allowing them to hack individual devices under certain situations.Ms. May, Britains home secretary, told lawmakers this year that such powers were required to defend the countrys security. She added that the legislation offered sufficient transparency and oversight about how British spies conducted their activities to calm peoples privacy concerns.
But for Apple and other Silicon Valley companies, the proposal also includes new powers that can permit the British government to demand that companies remove encryption protections where reasonably practicable to gain access to digital communications.The British government stresses that such rules would not undermine companies services because they may not apply to so-called end-to-end encryption, technology used by the likes of Apples iMessage and FaceTime services, as well as Facebooks WhatsApp Internet messenger.But in a series of appeals to the British Parliament, several American tech giants, including Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo, have complained that the proposals could force them to create backdoor access for the countrys spies, or face falling afoul of the new national security rules.A key left under the doormat would not just be there for the good guys, Apple wrote in its recent statement to British lawmakers. The bad guys would find it, too.Such concerns, security experts say, could be compounded if other national governments  either in Europe or farther afield  followed Britains lead by passing similar legislation.If these encryption plans go through, then whos to stop France or other countries asking for the same thing? said Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge who wrote a paper with other experts last year that criticized the American and British governments plans to weaken encryption. When you give one country backdoor access, where do you stop?
