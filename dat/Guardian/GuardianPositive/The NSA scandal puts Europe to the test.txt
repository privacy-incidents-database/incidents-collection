The NSA scandal puts Europe to the test

On one level we should hardly be shocked by the revelations that the National Security Agency has been tapping our phones and monitoring our metadata. The thing about secret services that is not so secret is that they all spy on each other. Some, like the Americans, probably do it better than others. Countless Hollywood movies and BBC dramas about spooks and covert operations have brought this reality into our living rooms. Yet we probably laboured under the assumption that our spies were only after the bad guys – those broadly falling inside George Bushs definition of the axis of evil – not our friends and allies. Angela Merkels discovery that her personal mobile phone had been a target of NSA hacking disrupted this weeks EU summit. The relationship she nurtured with the US president was suddenly undermined by questions about the true level of trust she thought they enjoyed. She was not alone, though. Leaked NSA memos revealed by the Guardian suggest up to 35 world leaders have been similarly treated. But this is not just an elite spying exercise. The NSA has been trawling through 70m communications from French citizens in the space of just one month. This is spying on a massive scale and clearly not exclusively directed at combating terrorism. A case can be made for secret services to monitor phone calls and internet use of suspected terrorists or criminal gangs under the supervision of a judge or a minister who can be held accountable, but the systematic hacking of world leaders goes way beyond the bounds of good behaviour; it would be a very ugly world if no one could be trusted. We should now be asking whether we have entered an Orwellian world of thought crimes and Big Brother. The anti-terrorism measures we are taking are having a deleterious effect on our civil liberties – our right to privacy and freedom to go about our business without fear that we are being monitored. The Snowden revelations have pointed to NSA back door spyware being implanted in devices at the point of manufacture and of internet and social media giants being compromised. Data stored on servers on US soil is no longer above suspicion, and who knows what happens to our airline passenger data that is collected every time we take a flight? Only last week MEPs voted to recommend the suspension of a controversial EU-US financial data-sharing agreement to assist with the US terrorist finance tracking programme. The agreement allows the US department for homeland security to access data from the Swift database (the conduit for all global financial transactions). Parliament had reluctantly accepted the agreement, following the personal intervention of Joe Biden, the US vice-president, and on condition of extra privacy safeguards. But allegations broadcast on Brazilian TV suggest that the system was hacked illegally. In light of all the evidence and new revelations, the US does not deserve the benefit of the doubt. The spying scandal will now put Europe to the test. It must show that it is both willing and able to protect the rights of European citizens and uphold its core principles. The European Commission and member states should translate their indignation into a firm response, not brush the scandal under the carpet, for there will surely be more to come. Parliaments recommendation to suspend the exchange of Swift data requires a proposal from the commission and backing from two-thirds of EU member states. They should dangle this like a sword of Damocles over the heads of the Americans: that co-operation will be halted if the snooping on allies does not stop. Second, no final agreement on a transatlantic trade and investment agreement between the EU and US can be concluded until this issue has been satisfactorily resolved. I would not recommend halting negotiations since a transatlantic free-trade area is manifestly in our own interests, but there will undoubtedly be chapters related to data privacy and regulation of online services that would be problematic in the current climate. Third, the EU is updating its data protection legislation in light of developments in digital and online technology over the last 15 years. The legislation was voted at committee stage last week and is due to be completed before the end of the current European parliamentary mandate in June next year. Indeed, this legislation is urgently needed so that nationals of all member states are equally protected from unauthorised data gathering. The US spying scandals have also forced the issue of extra-territoriality into the foreground. MEPs have reinserted the anti-Fisa clause, enabling the blocking of surveillance by foreign law-enforcement bodies, despite lobbying by the US administration to drop it. Guaranteeing national security is no easy matter and often pits one right against another. There will always be those who want more security or more privacy. What matters is knowing what is being done to protect our freedom so we can judge for ourselves and hold our politicians to account for the balance they strike. Without accountability, the state becomes all-powerful and we slip from democracy to dictatorship. The US (and possibly other countries participating in their programme or operating similar schemes) have been put in the spotlight and now have a duty to explain themselves to those they represent and serve. Governments have a duty to look after our safety, but in a free and open democracy they also have a duty to look after our liberty. In some countries, not least those in the Arab world fighting for their rights and freedoms, many are prepared to risk their lives for liberty. It is a sobering thought for all those who bear the responsibility of government.
