Guardian Faber are publishing the first, and definitive, book on Edward Snowden, The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the Worlds Most Wanted Man by Luke Harding on Thursday 6 February. Investigative journalism at its best, The Snowden Files tells the story of the individuals behind the biggest intelligence leak in history and the forces that tried to stop them. It began with a tantalising, anonymous email: I am a senior member of the intelligence community... What followed was the most spectacular intelligence breach ever, brought about by one man. The consequences have shaken the leaders of nations worldwide. This is the inside story of Edward Snowdens deeds and the journalists who faced down pressure from the US and UK governments to break a remarkable scoop. What drove Snowden to sacrifice himself? Award-winning Guardian journalist Luke Harding answers the question which should trouble every citizen of the internet age. Foreign rights have been sold in seven countries so far, including Brazil, China, Korea, Norway and Japan. Notes to editorsReview copies will be available on Monday 3 February.
