  7.17pm GMT       Russia has also now put out its own image in an attempt to counter the radar picture provided earlier by Turkey (See 10.26). While the Turkish image appeared to show that the Russian jet briefly flew over southern Turkey before it as shot down, Russia’s suggests that there has been no airspace violation.

Updated at 7.19pm GMT     7.07pm GMT       There has been abundance of images today surrounding the downed Russian jet, which has generated suspicions among some. Lindsey Hilsum, Channel 4 News International Editor, asks:     How come a Turkish TV crew was in the right place, filming in the right direction as Russian plane shot down? Lucky? Or tipped off? Lindsey Hilsum (@lindseyhilsum) November 24, 2015         7.05pm GMT       Elsewhere in the same conflict zone, an Assyrian group has said that the Islamic State (Isis) militant group have released 10 more Assyrian Christian hostages they had held captive in Syria since February. The Associated Press reports:  The 10 were part of more than 220 Assyrian Christians captured by the extremist group after it overran communities on the southern bank of Khabur River in the northeastern Syrian province of Hassakeh. The Assyrian Network for Human Rights said the 10 were released on Tuesday and that they are all in good condition. The Stockholm-based network says there are five women among the released. It says the release brings the number of Assyrian hostages that have so far been released to 98.  The network also says the release was the result of ongoing mediation efforts by the head of the Assyrian Church of the East in Syria.        7.00pm GMT       More now from the Russian military, and about that new statement that a marine on a helicopter sent in to search for the crew of the downed jet also died. Russia’s military general staff is quoted by Russian news agencies as saying that one of the pilots of the Su-24 warplane that was shot down by Turkey was killed by groundfire as he parachuted from his crippled plane. General staff spokesman Lt. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, added that rebels in Syria fired on a Russian helicopter that was searching for the two pilots of the Su-24. The shooting killed one crew member on the Mi-8 helicopter and forced it to land in neutral territory, he says. The rest of the crew was evacuated. Rudskoi also said that Russian radar data showed that Turkish warplanes had violated Syrian airspace in the course of shooting down the Russian plane       6.54pm GMT       When Putin labeled Turkey “accomplices of terrorists,” he was hinting at complex relationship which includes links between senior Isis figures and Turkish officials, explains the Guardian’s Martin Chulov in this analysis.  Turkey’s international airports have also been busy. Many, if not most, of the estimated 15,000-20,000 foreign fighters to have joined the Islamic State (Isis) have first flown into Istanbul or Adana, or arrived by ferry along its Mediterranean coast. The influx has offered fertile ground to allies of Assad who, well before a Turkish jet shot down a Russian fighter on Tuesday, had enabled, or even supported Isis. Vladimir Putin’s reference to Turkey as “accomplices of terrorists” is likely to resonate even among some of Ankara’s backers. From midway through 2012, when jihadis started to travel to Syria, their presence was apparent at all points of the journey to the border.  At Istanbul airport, in the southern cities of Hatay and Gaziantep – both of which were staging points – and in the border villages. Foreigners on their way to fight remained fixtures on these routes until late in 2014 when, after continued pressure from the EU states and the US, coordinated efforts were made to turn them back.  Read on here    Updated at 7.10pm GMT     6.34pm GMT    Russia: Marine on rescue helicopter died    Russian journalists are being given a briefing by the defence ministry, I’m told by the Guardian’s Shaun Walker in Moscow. These are the main lines so far as reported by RIA Novosti:  One of the two pilots has died, from “fire from the ground”. The fate of the second pilot remains unclear. A helicopter sent to rescue the pilots was hit, performed an emergency landing, and one of the marines on board died. Military contacts with Turkey will be severed. Russia says Syrian air traffic control shows the Turkish F-16 which shot down the Russian plane violated Syrian airspace.  It’s Ben Quinn here picking up the blog now from Mark.    Updated at 6.37pm GMT     6.24pm GMT       Here is a summary of the Obama-Hollande press conference at the White House. Ben Quinn is now taking over.  The US and France have agreed to step up strikes in Syria and Iraq to target Islamic State, but Hollande said France will not deploy ground forces. They agreed on the importance of closing the Turkish border to limit the movement of extremists into Europe.  Obama said Turkey had the right to defend its territory and air space. He says the downing of the Russian warplane by Turkey points to an “ongoing problem” with Russia’s airstrikes in Syria. If Russia would instead concentrate its airstrikes on the Islamic State group, he said, then mistakes would be “less likely to occur.” Both criticised Russia for hitting moderate Syrian opposition forces, which they said only bolster President Bashar al-Assad’s government. Hollande would not provide a date for Assad’s transition from power but said it must be “as soon as possible.”  They urged Turkey and Russia to talk directly to prevent any escalation. The White House said the incursion lasted only seconds. Nato officials said Turkish aircraft could have escorted the plane out of Turkey.        6.10pm GMT       In this video, a deputy commander of rebel Turkmen forces in Syria says his men shot at two Russian pilots after they ejected from their jet. He also claims to show parts of a Russian military parachute. Both Russia and its ally, the Syrian government, have carried out strikes in the area where the plane came down.                   6.04pm GMT    Russian military: one pilot is dead    The Russians have contradicted Turkish claims that both Russian pilots are alive. The Russian military general staff says one of the men is dead, reports the RIA news agency.    Updated at 6.44pm GMT     5.59pm GMT       In Brussels, Nato officials say the Russian jet entered Turkish airspace before it was shot down. Earlier the US said the Russian incursion into Turkish air space lasted just seconds. Nato ambassadors apparently believe Turkey could have shown more restraint. This from Reuters.  Diplomats present at the meeting told Reuters that while none of the 28 Nato envoys defended Russia’s actions, many expressed concern that Turkey did not escort the Russian warplane out of its airspace. “There are other ways of dealing with these kinds of incidents,” said one diplomat who declined to be named.      Updated at 6.13pm GMT     5.49pm GMT       Hollande says strikes must be against Daesh and stresses the need to resolve the Syria crisis, which is relevant not just to Syria’s neighbours but the wider world as refugees leave the region. The French president stresses France will not deploy ground troops as that is up to local forces. Obama says the US is backing local forces with training and equipment as well as launching air strikes. He says the Vienna process, which includes Iran (also backers of Assad) for the first time, is the best option.       5.34pm GMT    Obama: 'Turkey and Russia must talk and de-escalate'    On the downing of the Russian plane, Obama says it has the right to defend its territory and its airspace, and stresses the importance of Turkey and Russia working to de-escalate the situation. He says if Russia concentrates on Isis there would be fewer chances of mistakes. “The problem has been Russia’s focus on propping up Assad rather than concentrating on Isil.”       5.30pm GMT    Hollande: 'Assad must go'    Hollande expresses his gratitude to the US, says Obama was the first leader to call him after the Paris attacks. He says Isis has territory and considerable resources and has hit several different countries, including Russia. “We have decided to scale up our strikes against Isis in Syria and Iraq,” says Hollande, who adds that the recent UN security council resolution gives support to the coalition against Daesh, another name for Isis. He says Assad has to go because he is responsible for most of the deaths in Syria. On the refugee crisis, Hollande says a solution has to be found with Turkey that allows refugees to stay close to home. He says France can work with Russia if it concentrates on hitting Isis. Hollande is due in Moscow on Thursday to see Vladimir Putin, who is of course firmly behind Assad. This is one of the biggest points of contention in the Vienna process.       5.16pm GMT    Obama: 'we will win and groups like Isil will lose'    Obama again criticises Russia. He says Russian strikes against moderate opposition only bolster Assad and Isis, which he refers to as Isil. He reiterates the need to move away from Syrian president Assad in the Vienna talks. “They can’t defeat us on the battlefield, we cannot allow fear to divide us.” He says duties to security and to refugees go hand in hand. Obama cites past threats, world wars, cold war when the west prevailed. “It’ll be no different this time, we will win and groups like Isil will lose.”    Updated at 5.38pm GMT     5.07pm GMT    Obama: 'attack on Paris, an attack on world itself'    President Obama has just started a joint press conference with his French counterpart Francois Hollande at the White House. Calling France America’s oldest ally, he pays tribute to its culture and its joie de vivre. He happy memories of being in Paris with Michelle, including them kissing in the Jardin de Luxembourg. “Nous sommes tous Francais.” He says the attacks in Paris as an assault on the world itself. He claims that 8,000 airstrikes have pushed back Isis.       4.53pm GMT       Reuters is reporting that a Tunisian military bus carrying presidential guards has been hit by an explosion in central Tunis. Tunisia has suffered a couple of devastating attacks recently, including the massacre of tourists on a beach and the assault on the Bardo museum. Six people are reported dead.    Updated at 4.56pm GMT     4.45pm GMT    White House: 'Russian incursion into Turkish airspace lasted seconds'    Russia’s operation in Syria will continue despite the downing of a Russian fighter jet by the Turkish air force, the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. Meanwhile, a US official has said that initial indications are that the Russian incursion into Turkish airspace lasted a matter of seconds.       4.38pm GMT    Turkish official: 'Two Russian pilots still alive'    Despite earlier reports that the two pilots are dead, a Turkish official has told Reuters otherwise.  Turkey believes the two pilots from a Russian war plane it shot down close to the Syrian border on Tuesday are still alive and is working to secure their release from Syrian rebels, a Turkish government official told Reuters. “Our units, who received the information that the two pilots were alive, are working to get them from opposition rebels safely,” the official said.        4.32pm GMT       While EU president Donald Tusk appeals for calm, Russia and Turkey might choose to up the ante. Analysts Ege Seckin and Firas Abi Ali from IHS Country Risk consider the options for both.  In the medium term, Russia and Turkey both have escalation options against one another. Russia can increase the price of Russian gas, while Turkey can provide support to insurgents within Russian Caucasian republics and in Crimea. Russia is also likely to retaliate indirectly by increasing support for the Syrian-Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its Turkey-based counterpart, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).        4.15pm GMT    Russian plane 'acting against militants originating from Russia'    More from the Russian defence ministry, which follows Putin’s comments (see 13.02) that the Russian jet was taking action against militants originally from Russia.  “The Russian operations were against illegal terrorist formations mainly made up of fighters from Russia’s North Caucasus region… Attempts by Russian defence ministry specialists to make emergency contact with their Turkish counterparts were unsuccessful… The ministry is currently working out a range of measures to react to this kind of incident… Military operations against terrorists in Syria will continue.”     Updated at 4.20pm GMT     3.53pm GMT       On the diplomatic front, French president Francois Hollande has begun talks with Barack Obama at the White House. Hollande is seeking support for increased military action against Islamic State after the atrocities in Paris that left 130 dead. He received David Cameron at the Elysee palace yesterday. Hollande, who is to go on to Russia, has pleaded for the US and Russia to set aside their policy differences over Syria and “fight this terrorist army in a broad, single coalition”.    Updated at 4.09pm GMT     3.42pm GMT       Here is some historical background on past aerial clashes between the west and its allies and the Soviet Union.  No Nato country has shot down a Russian warplane since the end of the cold war, but there have been many incidents involving the west and the then Soviet Union. In the most high-profile case, Gary Powers’ U2 spy plane was shot down by Sam-2 anti-aircraft missiles in 1960. When the US refused to apologise, plans for a superpower summit in Paris collapsed. Powers was eventually swapped for a Soviet spy.  During the Korean war, there were several dogfights between Americans and Soviet pilots flying Migs in Chinese and North Korean markings. The last recorded downings of Soviet planes by US pilots came in November, 1952 when four Migs-15s were shot down during American air strikes against the North Korean port of Hoeryong, near the major Soviet base at Vladivostok.  Captain Royce Williams, a US Navy pilot, was credited with shooting down three of the Migs, possibly the fourth as well. During the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, Pakistani pilots flying American-made F-16s shot down at least 10 Soviet aircraft in the late 1980s.        3.30pm GMT    Russian state tourism agency recommends suspension of Turkish tours    Russia’s state tourism agency Rostourism is recommending suspending sales of tour packages to Turkey the Russian RIA news agency reports.       3.24pm GMT       It’s a tough day for Moscow. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports that Syrian fighters destroyed a Russian helicopter with a missile, shortly after they forced it to make an emergency landing in a nearby government-held area in Syria’s Latakia province. A Syrian insurgent group, which receives US Tow missiles, said its fighters hit the helicopter with an anti-tank missile while it was in the air and put out a video showing the helicopter being blown up after one of its fighters struck it with another missile.   Rami Abdulrahman from the Observatory said at least 10 people were on the helicopter when it was hit but they were all evacuated when it landed and before the missile destroyed it.        3.19pm GMT       Donald Tusk, EU president, has called for calm. The former Polish prime minister is due to host a EU summit with Turkey in Brussels on Sunday which was supposed to deal with the refugee crisis.    In this dangerous moment after downing of Russian jet, all should remain cool headed and calm Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) November 24, 2015         2.51pm GMT    Lavrov cancels planned visit to Turkey       Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images    No great surprise this, but Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has cancelled a planned visit to Turkey.  Lavrov was due to visit Ankara on Wednesday for bilateral talks. Turkish officials had insited it would go ahead as planned.  Lavrov, speaking to reporters in the southern Russian city of Sochi, advised Russians not to visit Turkey and said the threat of terrorism there was the no less than in Egypt, where a bomb attack brought down a Russian passenger plane last month.  One of the possible retaliatory measures Russia could take would be ban flights to Turkey, as Moscow did with Egypt after the Metrojet bombing over Sinai last month, writes Shaun Walker. There are dozens of flights a day between the two countries, so such a move would undoubtedly seriously affect trade and tourism. (That’s it from me. I’m handling the live blog over to Mark Tran).    Updated at 2.57pm GMT     2.40pm GMT       Don’t be too alarmed by Putin’s tough talking, cautions Russia analyst and New York University professor Mark Galeotti. In a blogpost on his first thought about the incident, he says:   I suspect neither Moscow nor, at the very least, the other European Nato powers will want to let this go too far. Russia cannot fight hot diplomatic wars on too many fronts, and Europe clearly wants Moscow to be part of the solution in Syria and maybe Ukraine, too. And, frankly, there is in many capitals concern about Turkey, its agenda and its role in the region. Much will depend on where Washington falls, of course, but if Moscow can get even a crumb of contrition from Ankara or sympathy from Europe, then we can expect this to be splashed on Russian TV and allow the Kremlin to let this slide a little. But even in this best-case scenario, I don’t imagine that will be the end to it. Moscow has already been willing to operate inside Turkey covertly, and is engaged in political tussles over influence in the South Caucasus as well as Middle East. I would expect some uptick in ‘mischief’ – perhaps some support for the Kurds or other violent extreme movements, for example – as well as a more assiduous campaign to push back and stymie Turkish regional ambitions. It’s often said, with good reason, that Putin really wants a return to 19th century geopolitics, when might made right and realpolitik was all. Let’s not forget that one of the defining 19thcentury conflicts was that between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, which were sometimes openly at war, sometimes ostensibly at peace, but never anything than enemies. Here we go again.        2.33pm GMT       Shaun Walker reports more sabre-rattling in Moscow. Writing on Twitter Alexei Pushkov, the head of the Russian parliament’s international relations committee, said: “Ankara clearly did not weigh the consequences of its hostile acts for Turkey’s interests and economy. The consequences will be very serious.”    Анкара явно не просчитала последствий своих враждебных действий для интересов Турции и ее экономики. Последствия будут очень серьезные.

PA reports the exchange:  Hammond insisted Turkey will remain a “very important partner” for the UK, hours after it shot down a Russian war plane near the Syria border. Labour’s Dennis Skinner pressed Hammond for his views on Turkey’s role agains Islamic State following the incident.  He also accused Turkey of buying oil from the terror group, “in order to prop them up”.  Hammond replied: “I see old habits die hard and you remain an apologist for Russian actions. On the question of Turkey, Turkey is an important Nato ally.  “It holds the key to a number of really very important questions, both in relation to the battle against Isil but also in relation to the migration challenge that Europe faces, and it will remain a very important partner for this country and for the European Union.”  Skinner had asked Hammond: “Do you regard Turkey as a reliable ally in the battle against Isil [Isis]? “When you consider that not only today that they’ve shot down a Russian jet - who are also trying to fight Isil - they’re buying oil from Isil in order to prop them up, they’re bombing the Kurds who are also fighting Isil.  “This Syrian engagement is an almighty mess.”         2.04pm GMT       Turkey’s news agency Dogan repeats reports that Turkmen commanders have stated that their forces shot both Russian pilots while they were parachuting down, and that they have the bodies. This is also unconfirmed. There have been conflicting reports about the fate of the pilots. One appeared to be dead in disturbing and unverified video footage.     Updated at 2.05pm GMT     1.59pm GMT       There are unconfirmed reports by Syrian rebels that a Russia helicopter has been shot over Syria’s Latakia province while trying to recover the pilots of the downed jet.

Davutoglu said:   “We want the international community to know that we are ready for any kind of sacrifice when the security and life of our citizens and our border security are concerned. The downing of a jet that had violated Turkish airspace today has to be seen in this context as well.  “We do not adopt an approach that impeaches on the sovereignty of any country. But the world needs to know that it is our international right and our national duty to take measures against anybody who violates our borders on the land and in the air, in spite of our many warnings.”        1.39pm GMT       Here are the key quotes from Putin’s statement:  “The loss today is a stab in the back, carried out by the accomplices of terrorists. I can’t describe it in any other way.”   “Our aircraft was downed over the territory of Syria, using air-to-air missile from a Turkish F-16. It fell on the Syrian territory 4km from Turkey.”   “Neither our pilots nor our jet threatened the territory of Turkey.”   “Today’s tragic event will have significant consequences, including for Russia-Turkish relations ... Instead of immediately getting in contact with us, as far as we know, the Turkish side immediately turned to their partners from Nato to discuss this incident, as if we shot down their plane and not they ours.”   “Do they want to make Nato serve ISIS? ... We hope that the international community will find the strength to come together and fight against the common evil.”        1.24pm GMT    Summary    Here’s a summary of where things currently stand amid conflicting versions of exactly what happened and terse verbal exchanges between Russia and Turkey.  Russia’s president Vladimir Putin has warned Turkey of ‘serious consequences’ after a Russia fighter jet was shot down close to Turkey’s border with Syria. Putin described the incident as a “stab in the back” and accused Turkey of siding with Islamic State militants in Syria. Turkey has summoned Russia’s envoy in Ankara and said it had a right to defend its territory. A Turkish official said: “This isn’t an action against any specific country: Our F-16s took necessary steps to defend Turkey’s sovereign territory.” The Turkish military said it shot down the plane after it penetrated Turkish airspace in the province of Hatay at 9.20am warning it to leave 10 times in five minutes before it was shot down. Turkey published radar images claiming to show the plane briefly flying over its southern territory. Russia said its SU-24 plane never left Syrian airspace. Putin said it came down 4km from the border with Turkey and did not pose a threat to Turkey.  Video footage showed the pilots parachuting out of the plane before it crashed. An anti-Assad rebel group in Syria said both pilots were killed after parachuting from the jet. This has yet to be confirmed.  Turkey is to brief fellow Nato members about the incident at an extraordinary meeting in Brussels at 1600 GMT. The meeting was requested by Turkey.     Map showing the location of the downed Russian warplane Map showing the location of the downed Russian warplane        1.12pm GMT       Putin added this provocative comment at the end of his statement.  Do they want to make Nato serve ISIS? I understand that every state has its own regional interests and we’ve always respected that, but we will never allow the kind of crime that happened to today to take place. And of course we hope that the international community will find the strength to come together and fight against the common evil.        1.02pm GMT    Putin warns of 'significant consequences'       Vladimir Putin Photograph: Xinhua/REX Shutterstock    Putin warns Turkey of “significant consequences”.  Speaking ahead of his meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan in Sochi, the Russian leader said:  This event is beyond the normal framework of fighting against terrorism. Of course our military is doing heroic work against terrorism... But the loss today is a stab in the back, carried out by the accomplices of terrorists. I can’t describe it in any other way. Our aircraft was downed over the territory of Syria, using air-to-air missile from a Turkish F-16. It fell on the Syrian territory 4km from Turkey.  Neither our pilots nor our jet threatened the territory of Turkey. This is obvious. They are fighting terrorists in the northern areas around Latakia, where militants are located, mainly people who originated in Russia, and they were pursuing their direct duty, to make sure these people do not return to Russia. These are people who are clearly international terrorists. Taking into account that we signed an agreement on deconflicting with the US, and as we know Turkey was among the ones that has joined the US coalition. Since Isis has such huge resources of hundreds of millions and billions of dollars coming from illicit oil sales, and they are protected by the armed forces of other states, then it’s clear why they are so brazen, why they are killing people, why they are carrying out terrorist attacks throughout the world including in the heart of Europe. We will analyse everything, and today’s tragic event will have significant consequences, including for Russia-Turkish relations. We have always treated Turkey as a friendly state. I don’t know who was interested in what happened today, certainly not us. And instead of immediately getting in contact with us, as far as we know, the Turkish side immediately turned to their partners from Nato to discuss this incident, as if we shot down their plane and not they ours.     Updated at 1.08pm GMT     12.58pm GMT       Turkey prime minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, speaking at the same time as Putin, insisted it Turkey had a right to respond to violations of its airspace.        12.55pm GMT    Putin describes incident as a 'stab in the back'    Vladimir Putin said the loss of the jet “is a stab in the back, carried out by the accomplices of terrorists”. In his first comments on the incident he said: “I can’t describe it in any other way.” The Russian President said the jet was downed 4km inside Syria. He claimed the pilots were not a threat.  He claimed that large amount of oil from militants in Syria end up in Syria.       12.50pm GMT    'Both pilots killed'    There are unconfirmed reports that both pilots were killed after parachuting from the Russian jet. Charles Lister, analyst from BrookingsDoha, said both pilots were killed citing an anti-Assad rebel source.

Updated at 4.57pm GMT     12.34pm GMT       The downing of the Russian jet has sparked grave concerns in Greece, Turkey’s neighbour and for years its Nato rival, reports Helena Smith in Athens.   Diplomats are expressing thinly disguised alarm. In a country, which frequently complains of Turkish fighter jets both violating and buzzing Greek airspace over the Aegean, the shooting of the SU-24 is being described by diplomats in private “as an extremely serious incident” that has prompted “high concern.”  “This is the first time since the beginning of the cold war that a member of Nato destroys a Russian military aircraft,” said one. “It is an extremely serious incident. There is high concern [in Athens].”      Updated at 12.39pm GMT     12.12pm GMT       Ankara had made it very clear to Russia it was unhappy with Russian military activities close to its border, and even summoned the Russian ambassador and military attaché last Friday to make a complaint, Turkey’s Hurriyet reported this morning writes Shaun Walker.   The newspaper said the Turks warned the Russian ambassador they would retaliate and take necessary measures if their border security was threatened by operations against Turkmen Syrians close to the border. Turkish officials told the diplomats that Turkmen civilians were suffering as a result of Russian operations, and said the proximity to the Turkish border meant there was a possibility of a violation of Turkey’s border security. “It should be noted Turkey’s rules of engagement were in place and there will be no hesitation to implement them if such a violation occurs,” the Russians were told, Hurriyet claimed.         12.08pm GMT    Nato confirms meeting    Nato has confirmed it will hold an extraordinary council meeting on Turkey’s request. Here’s its statement:  At the request of Turkey, the North Atlantic Council will hold an extraordinary meeting at 17.00 (Brussels time). The aim of this extraordinary NAC meeting is for Turkey to inform allies about the downing of a Russian airplane. Nato is monitoring the situation closely.
