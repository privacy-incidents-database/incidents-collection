David Gilmours wife has revealed that Pink Floyd will release a new album this October. The Endless River is the groups first album since 1994s The Division Bell, and was reportedly inspired by the same recording sessions. Polly Samson, who married Gilmour in 1994, unveiled Pink Floyds secret plans on her Twitter account. In addition to announcing the albums title and release date, she referred to the record as Rick Wrights swansong. Wright, who co-founded Pink Floyd with Syd Barrett, Nick Mason and Roger Waters, died in 2008.        Vocalist Durga McBroom-Hudson, who has toured with Gilmour and Pink Floyd, subsequently shared some further details. The recording did start during The Division Bell sessions (and yes, it was the side project originally titled The Big Spliff that Nick Mason spoke about), she wrote on Facebook. David and Nick have gone in and done a lot more since then. That Big Spliff session was described in Masons memoir Inside Out, where he called it ambient mood music akin to bands like the Orb. According to McBroom-Hudson, The Endless River was originally to be a completely instrumental recording. But Gilmour gradually changed his mind, inviting McBroom-Hudson to record backup vocals last December and adding more singing since then. Gilmour has done a lead on at least one [track], she said, and Samson, who co-wrote seven of The Division Bells tracks, described herself on Twitter as one of The Endless Rivers lyricists.  In addition to finishing Pink Floyds 15th studio album, Gilmour is also allegedly still working on a new solo album. And McBroom-Hudson said that the band could indeed mount a new tour. STAY TUNED, she wrote. When Pink Floyd last hit the road, in 1994, it was the highest-grossing rock tour in history. The Division Bell, which originally debuted at No 1, was reissued in a deluxe set on 30 June. This new edition landed at No 52.
