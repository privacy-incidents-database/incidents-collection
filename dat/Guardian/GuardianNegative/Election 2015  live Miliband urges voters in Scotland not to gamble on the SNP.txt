Election 2015  live: Miliband urges voters in Scotland not to "gamble" on the SNP

  9.23pm BST       We have an interview with Ed Miliband in tomorrow’s Guardian and available to read online here. Speaking ahead of the closest election in a generation, the Labour leader attacks David Cameron for being reduced to arguing that “the key question facing the country is a battle of resources between London and Scotland”.       9.11pm BST    Evening summary    This time next week we’ll know what the results of the general election are, and, if today’s to-ing and fro-ing is anything to go by, it’s not going to be smooth sailing. After last night’s ask the leaders edition of BBC Question Time, party leaders battled it out to see who dismiss the other quicker while simultaneously trying to present themselves as the only viable option for Britain. Here’s everything that happened today. The big picture     Ed Milliband speaks at an election rally in Glasgow. Photograph: Paul Hackett/Reuters    Ed Miliband spoke at a rally in Glasgow tonight, where he urged voters not to “gamble” on the SNP and insisted his opposition to doing a post-election deal with Nicola Sturgeon’s party is a matter of principle. He said Labour could not “do a deal with a party that wants to break up the UK when we want to build it up”. He also refused to accept Nicola Sturgeon’s claim that Labour’s failure to work with the SNP would result in David Cameron winning a second term as prime minister, and said the only thing the SNP wants is another independence referendum.  If we set England against Scotland, if we set any part of our country against another, it does not help working people, it harms working people. It undermines the ability to share resources. It drives down wages and conditions in the race to the bottom. Nationalism doesn’t understand we are stronger, not weaker, when we look after each other across the whole of our country. Nationalism never built a school. It never lifted people out of poverty. It never created a welfare state that healed the sick and protected our most vulnerable. Nationalism cannot create the jobs we need.  It was an impassioned and rising speech from Miliband in a region where Labour is on course to be completely wiped out. Whether it will be enough to win back some support from the nationalists is unclear – only time will tell. Either way, Scotland is looking like the key battleground in this final week of election campaigning. What happened today  Ed Miliband announced Labour would effectively cancel the bedroom tax on its first day in office. It would do that by making funds available to councils to allow them to compensate people for the cost of the bedroom tax in full.   David Cameron accidentally said the election would be a “career-defining” one instead of a country-defining one during a speech at Asda headquarters in Leeds. He also failed to rule out a cut in child benefits during the course of the next parliament.   Nicola Sturgeon said Ed Miliband’s comments last night ruling out a deal with the SNP, even if that costs him his chance of forming a government, will be “disastrous” for Labour in Scotland.   Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems would only go into coalition with a party who will invest an extra £8bn a year on the NHS and will introduce maximum waiting times for mental health services.   Nigel Farage said he would “absolutely not” help Labour form a government, and also ruled out a formal coalition with the Tories and the Lib Dems, saying he would rather “drive the agenda” rather than accept a ministerial car.   Latest polling by Lord Ashcroft in marginal constituencies revealed that Tory voters might just save Jim Murphy - who is now only 3 points behind the SNP in East Renfrewshire - and that the Conservatives have completely reversed Labour’s previous four-point lead in Croydon Central.   The Green Party launched its LGBTIQ Manifesto, which contained pledges to: review the discriminatory blood ban, introduce LGBTIQ-inclusive sex education, protect LGBTIQ asylum seekers, improve services for trans people, and promote LGBTIQ rights abroad.

That’s it from me today. Join me again tomorrow morning for the first day of the final weekend of the general election campaign, as I bring you all the news, reaction, fall-out, pictures and sometimes even, jokes from the trail. I think it’s safe to say it’s not going to be a relaxing weekend for politicians. Or for us, who continue to keep a watchful eye on them.

We have 60 in five key seats giving their view throughout the campaign as part of our polling project with BritainThinks. They each have an app and are telling us what they think of stories as they crop up. Below are some of their thoughts, from party political tattoos to potential back room coalition deals:          8.47pm BST       Occupy Democracy protesters have gathered in London’s Parliament Square in a bid to concentrate the minds of voters ahead of polling day, and plan to remain there if there is a hung parliament.

Organiser George Barda said the protesters hope to stay in the heart of Westminster beyond election day, as there may be some: “political horse trading” if there is a minority government, and said that they hope to show that people of various interests need to be represented in politics. Mr Barda added:   We have come out in to Parliament Square which is a symbolic and iconic location for democracy in the world, supposedly, [and] seems like a sensible thing to do when there is so much spin being told to people.

Updated at 8.48pm BST     8.30pm BST       The former Labour first minister Jack McConnell has said that Miliband will struggle to form a government if Labour is not the biggest party. Lord McConnell told BBC Newsnight that if David Cameron wins more seats, even without a majority, “the public perception will be that he has won” and “anyone who tries to get around that, to get a deal to get a different PM, will be in trouble.”  Even if Cameron was to lose a few seats, if he still has a few seats more than Labour then public perception will be that he has won. Therefore the SNP argument that everybody else could gang up on him will not work. If we get to Friday morning and the sitting prime minister who is in Number 10 has won more seats than anyone else he will automatically get the first go and the public will expect him to do that.     Updated at 8.30pm BST     8.26pm BST       Nicola Sturgeon has said the SNP would vote down a Labour budget if it imposed cuts.

The party’s deputy leader Stewart Hosie emphasised the SNP’s platform to promote progressive policies.  Mr Miliband sacrificed any claim to progressive politics on Thursday night, when he indicated that he would prefer to let the Tories back in to continue their cuts and damage to society for five more years, rather than work with the SNP to keep them out. That represents a further abandonment of principle by Labour. The SNP have a platform to promote progressive policies for the benefit of Scotland and the whole UK at this election - including an end to the cuts, new investment in our NHS, and a minimum wage of £8.70 by 2020. It is clear that electing a big group of SNP MPs next Thursday is the way to lock the Tories out of Downing Street, and achieve the decisive position needed to deliver these progressive policies.        8.19pm BST       More data on the BBC Question Time debate The most searched leaders on Google during the debate:  David Cameron: 27.7% Ed Miliband: 53.7% Nick Clegg: 18.6% Here are the top questions for each:  Cameron:  What does David Cameron say about austerity?

Photograph: Paul Hackett/Reuters    Miliband gave a powerful and rising speech in Glasgow. He urged Scottish voters to remember their grandfathers and parents who worked hard and fought for Labour in the past. Citing “great” Labour leaders throughout history, Miliband seemed confident and managed to get through his speech without any notes and without stumbling once. Angry nationalist protests outside the venue might even have worked to his benefit, as he warned of the dangers of separatism and billed his party as the party of social justice across the whole of the UK. Here are the key points from his speech:  Miliband told voters not to “gamble” on the SNP and insisted his opposition to doing a post-election deal with Nicola Sturgeon’s party is a matter of principle. He said his party could not “do a deal with a party that wants to break up the UK when we want to build it up”.   I know the people of Scotland want a more just society. And with food banks, payday lenders and the neglect of the NHS, Scottish people feel there must be no delay. That’s why I have a clear message for the people of Scotland today: don’t gamble with the SNP when you can guarantee change with Labour. I am also clear there will be no deal, no pact, no coalition, no tie-in with the SNP. I don’t say that for tactical reasons - I’m advocating this for principled reasons. We cannot do a deal with a party that wants to break up the UK when we want to build it up.   Miliband refused to accept Nicola Sturgeon’s claim that Labour’s failure to work with the SNP would result in David Cameron winning a second term as prime minister. He said it was the SNP winning seats from Labour that would increase the Tories’ chances of being the largest party.    I will never put the Tories into government. I have spent my entire political career fighting them. But the tragedy is that the SNP may very well might let the Tories in. That’s what could happen if the Tories are the largest party.   Miliband said the only thing the SNP wants is a second independence referendum. “That’s their priority. That’s their promise. But it is not ours. Our priority is social justice,” he said.   Miliband said Labour believes in the principles of sharing and solidarity that underpin the partnerships of four nations that is the modern UK. He added:   If we set England against Scotland, if we set any part of our country against another, it does not help working people, it harms working people. It undermines the ability to share resources. It drives down wages and conditions in the race to the bottom. Nationalism doesn’t understand we are stronger, not weaker, when we look after each other across the whole of our country.  Nationalism never built a school. It never lifted people out of poverty. It never created a welfare state that healed the sick and protected our most vulnerable. Nationalism cannot create the jobs we need.   Miliband also spoke about Labour’s plans for a future government, including devolving more powers to the Scottish parliament, banning zero-hours contracts, giving regulators the power to cut energy prices, introducing a 50p tax rate, taxing bankers’ bonuses, abolishing non-doms and the bedroom tax.   Under my government, those with the broadest shoulders will bear the greatest burden. And in the country I lead, there’ll be no hiding place for the hedge funds, the tax havens who shield the tax avoiders, the Tory party donors who think tax avoiders is something everybody does.  That is what the pooling and sharing and resources means. That is what solidarity and social justice is all about.     Updated at 8.51pm BST     7.57pm BST       Miliband says he wants to devolve more powers to Scottish parliament, to make it one of the most powerful and devolved in the world. He talks about zero-hours contracts and big energy companies. “I’m going to do the right thing for working people, we’re going to give the regulator the power to cut prices this winter.” He adds Labour will introduce 50p tax rate. “Under my government, those with the broadest shoulders will bear the greatest burden. And in the country I lead, there’ll be no hiding place for the hedge funds, the tax havens who shield the tax avoiders, the Tory party donors who think tax avoiders is something everybody does. We will abolish non-dom status.” He says Labour will tax the bankers’ bonuses and use those resources to put young people back to work. “That is what the pooling and sharing and resources means. That is what solidarity and social justice is all about.” Miliband says he wants to go further. “We want to abolish the bedroom tax. The indefensible and cruel tax, that tells you everything you need to know about a Tory government. We will legislate straight away to abolish the bedroom tax.”    Updated at 7.57pm BST     7.52pm BST       There’s only one thing the SNP want and thats independence, Miliband. “If you want social justice, not separatism, vote for a Labour government.”       7.51pm BST       More from Miliband:  If we set England against Scotland, it does not help working people, it harms working people. It undermines the ability to share resources. Nationalism doesn’t understand we are stronger, not weaker when we look after each other across the whole of the country. Nationalism never built schools or lifted people out of poverty. It cannot create the jobs we need.        7.49pm BST       Miliband tells voters not to “gamble with the SNP” and says there will be “no deal or coalition” with them. He says this stance is for “principled reasons not tactical reasons.”       7.48pm BST       Miliband says Cameron has not ruled out cuts in child benefit, he’s not even pretending like last time. “We have 6 days to save your child benefit. I’ll protect tax credits. I’ll protect child benefit. Vote Labour to put your country first.”        7.46pm BST       Ed Miliband says he’s got a simple message. “People have the opportunity to be part of change. This is one of the most important elections our country has ever seen. The differences couldn’t be clearer between my vision and David Cameron’s. It’s about a different idea about how a country succeeds.” He says wealth does not trickle down, Cameron’s vision fails the people of Scotland and Britain. “We know the damage that five years of a Tory government has done”.

After days of weasel words and prevarication David Cameron is still failing to rule out cutting child benefit and tax credits again. All he has said again is he won’t abolish child benefit, but he won’t deny he plans to cut it or take it away from millions of families. Everyone knows it’s impossible for the Tories to achieve their £12 billion of cuts to social security without hitting family budgets hard. Child benefit and tax credits are now on the ballot paper next week. While Labour will protect them, the whole country now knows the Tories will cut them again.        6.55pm BST       While hundreds of Nicola Sturgeons spring up in London as she tours Scotland by helicopter, David Cameron goes to Asda, and Jim Murphy shows his strength in Paisley – here’s our election photo highlights of the day:   Related: Election photo highlights: The leaders are out in force as campaigning continues around the country      Updated at 7.27pm BST     6.48pm BST       Nigel Farage has accused Ed Miliband of turning his back on the British public by saying the country cannot have a referendum on European Union membership.

Dave had just confirmed out loud the very reason why so many voters find him hard to trust. He isn’t in the job primarily to make the country better and heal north-south divided: he is what everyone most fears and dislikes. A career politician. A man, who apart from a few year’s working as a PR man for a TV station, has known no life outside the Westminster bubble. A man who quite possibly understands the concerns of ordinary people even less than those other career politicians, Ed and Nick.

Lib Dem campaign spokesperson Lord Scriven blamed Labour for the social housing crisis and said Miliband needs to be honest with voters.  Under Ed Miliband’s watch social housing fell by 421,000 - the lowest level since the 1960s - and it was a Labour government that introduced the so-called ‘Bedroom Tax’ in the private sector.  Only the Liberal Democrats have the solutions for sensible reform to the Spare Room Subsidy, so that more families have access to suitable properties, while ensuring no-one is forced out of their home unfairly. Yesterday Ed Miliband refused to say that Labour overspent in government. Today he refuses to accept responsibility for the social housing crisis he left.  It is time he was honest with voters. Only the Liberal Democrats will build a stronger economy and a fairer society, creating opportunity for all.        5.27pm BST    Survation poll: Labour 1pt ahead    The latest Survation poll puts Labour one point ahead of the Conservatives.

Now here’s something creative sent to us via guardian witness, based on the photos of the leaders – who are all in their 40s – from today’s Guardian front page.           Dave and Nick looking older according to Microsoft age guessing app   Try for yourself. http:\\http://how-old.net/        Sent via GuardianWitness    By  mspatey   1 May 2015, 14:40       According to Microsoft’s new facial analysis tool How Old Do I Look, it seems as though the last five years may have taken it’s toll on the coalition partners: with David Cameron to appear looking 53 years-old and Nick Clegg 59 years-old, on the age-guessing app. While the state-of-the-art cloud-based algorithm estimates Ed Miliband looking like he’s 31 years-old.       5.19pm BST       The polls have been in deadlock since the middle of March with Labour and the Conservatives both hovering around 33.5%. But that is no longer the case – the Tories are now ahead.   poll   While figures this week have ranged from a Conservative six-point lead to a Labour three-point advantage, it is not the size of a lead that is so important, but the relative vote share of the two parties within individual polls. Here the trend is both clear and consistent across the polls: support for the Tories during the campaign has ranged on average from 32.5 to 35.5% compared with Labour’s 32 to 34.5% – and the Conservatives are now polling closer to the top of their range. Over the past two weeks, David Cameron’s party has opened up a two-point lead in the Guardian’s average of polls. The Tories ended the week on around 34.5%, two points ahead of Labour. However, while these percentages would probably make the Conservatives the largest party due to the losses Labour is expected to make in Scotland, this wouldn’t automatically mean that Cameron stays in Downing Street. As things stand, the arithmetic is to the advantage of Miliband. This is because the sum of the “anti-Tory” bloc – those parties that have said they would vote a Tory government down – currently adds up to 329 seats: a majority. While tallying up all the possible sources of support for a Cameron-led government yields 315 votes. In order to have the numbers he needs to stay in government, the PM needs his party to win about 290 seats, and for Labour to drop to 260. The differences from here to there may seem small, and if the Tories’ current two-point lead turns into four or five points in the next five days, Cameron may well find he has done enough to cling on. However, under the bonnet of the two blocs, the mechanics that could propel one to Number 10 are more complicated for Cameron than they are for Miliband.

I’ve wittled down the key points for you:  Miliband says the housing crisis is the single biggest issue facing Londoners and fixing it will be one of his top priorities as prime minister.   Our aim is to build 200,000 homes a year by 2020 and help local authorities give priority to first-time buyers. We’ll help renters by introducing new three-year tenancies which will limit rent rises, and we’ll ban letting agencies from charging tenants letting fees. We have to do something about foreign investors who keep properties empty just to watch the value increase. Councils will be able to charge double the council tax if flats are left vacant for more than a year, and off-plan sales will have to be offered in Britain first, not overseas.   Miliband says he will have a Cycle Safety Assessment for all new road schemes in London as well as restoring national targets to cut deaths and serious injuries. “We will introduce tough new rules for HGVs, which have been involved in three deaths already this year,” he says.   Miliband says he will make it easier to see a GP, so people aren’t forced to go to AE.   Currently one in four people wait a week or more to see a GP. We will guarantee GP appointments within 48 hours, or on the same day if you need it. Our Time to Care Fund will create 8,000 more GPs, who will help deliver this guarantee.  Another key thing is to ensure that older people can get the care they need at home – many vital care services have been stripped back over the last 5 years.  Our plans to improve GP access will help ease the pressure on hospital wards. So will our guarantee of a maximum one-week wait for cancer tests, which will include more testing in GP surgeries and community clinics.   Miliband says he would have more police on the beat to battle gangs.   Under David Cameron there are 4,000 fewer uniformed officers on London’s streets, whereas I’ve committed a Labour Government to protecting 10,000 police jobs across the UK. It’s a scandal that the Metropolitan Police Force is still so unrepresentative of London’s diversity. We will place a requirement on all police forces to actively recruit more black and ethnic minority officers.   Miliband says he will deliver a national framework so local authorities can encourage cleaner vehicles and will support proposals for the Ultra Low Emission Zone to be opened up to the whole of London.   He says will set targets to ensure more women are represented at boardroom level and set up a review into the ethnic diversity in top jobs. “And we will take action to make our police, judiciary and civil servants more representative of London’s diversity.”        4.51pm BST       The Green Party has launched its LGBTIQ Manifesto. The manifesto contains pledges to:       Review the discriminatory blood ban Introduce LGBTIQ-inclusive sex education Protect LGBTIQ asylum seekers Improve services for trans people Promote LGBTIQ rights abroad  Natalie Bennett launched the manifesto in Soho earlier today alongside LGBT campaigner Peter Tatchell. She said:  Homophobia, transphobia and biphobia are still all too common in our society. Too many people still fear persecution – at home, in the workplace and on the street. In Parliament the Greens’ Caroline Lucas has been a tireless advocate for equal rights.
