AT this time   as flight attendants like to begin each announcement   I would like to direct your attention to the new rules.

Memo Pad

(September 5, 2006)




The Transportation Security Administration has quietly revised its list of things you can and cannot carry onto a plane. It is now lawful (which it was not two weeks ago) to have the following: small amounts of baby formula or breast milk, if accompanied by a baby; up to four ounces of essential medications, including saline solutions and KY jelly; gel-filled bras and similar prosthetics; and gel-filled wheelchair cushions. Under the new rules, available at tsa.gov, you are also permitted to carry on solid cosmetics and personal hygiene items such as lipstick, lip balm and similar solids. The notice adds, Please remember these items must be solid and not liquid, gel or aerosol. (Excepting, of course, the permissible gel bras and cushions and the KY jelly).Suddenly, my mind is back in the thickets of high school chemistry class, having just stumbled out of English class where the play under discussion was by Samuel Beckett. What are the specific differences between a liquid, a solid and a gel? And more existentially, how is a gel-filled cushion unlike a bowl of jelly? This routine at airport checkpoints is starting to resemble the theater of the absurd. No wonder Steve Brill has more than 27,000 people signed up in Orlando, Fla., for Clear, the only operating version of the Registered Traveler program. Under the program, a traveler agrees to a federal background check and, once cleared, is issued an I.D. card encoded with fingerprint and iris images by Mr. Brills company, Verified Identity Pass. The card gets you through a special expedited security checkpoint. It evidently is perceived as having value among frequent fliers in Orlando, where it began 13 months ago and where renewal rates are about 92 percent, Mr. Brill said.While the Registered Traveler program has critics who question its value, it appears to be catching on, and companies other than Mr. Brills are expected to enter the market eventually. This fall, Mr. Brill said, Verified Identity expects to open a checkpoint at Terminal 7 at Kennedy International Airport in New York, in a partnership with  British Airways, that terminals major tenant. Under T.S.A. regulations, airlines  which often control entire terminals  as well as airports can offer the program.Mr. Brills company also has agreements, pending T.S.A. approval, to begin programs at airports in San Jose, Calif., Indianapolis and Cincinnati, as well as a Canadian version in Toronto. About 20 other airports, like Los Angeles and Atlanta, have filed statements of interest in the Registered Traveler program with the T.S.A. Right now, the major benefit of membership is predictability. Travelers know they will move through the Clear checkpoint in Orlando and through the T.S.A. security station in minutes, even when other lines are backed up. As the program is introduced more widely, it is expected that technology now being tested by the T.S.A will let Registered Traveler members avoid having to remove shoes or items like  jackets. A kiosk using fingerprint explosives-trace detection and shoe scanning is being tested under T.S.A. supervision at the Clear checkpoint in Orlando, Mr. Brill said. That technology is the result of a partnership between Verified Identity and the  General Electric Company.Other explosives-trace technology has been in development for checkpoints in general, and has even been installed for testing in 34 airports. But citing delays and uncertain reliability, the T.S.A. said recently that it was suspending installation of these electronic devices, known as puffers because they use puffs of air to look for traces of explosives on passengers. Mr. Brill said that the technology being tested for Verified Identity in Orlando was the opposite of puffer technology;  it requires a passenger to press a finger down for an electronic scan that tries to detect traces of explosives, while at the same time standing on a shoe-scanning device. In an article in The  New York Times on Sunday about the suspension of the installation of puffer devices, Randy Null, the T.S.A.s chief technology officer, said, What we are finding is that an actual finger scan may be a more effective way.Whatever the technology, some critics of the Registered Traveler program said it was not worth the effort. All it does is create a select class of people who pay 80 bucks in order to get in a shorter line. And most of those hijackers on 9/11 could have passed the background check, said Michael Boyd, of the air travel forecasting firm the Boyd Group. He added, And how do you do a background check, say, on a 21-year-old? Call his English teacher?E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com
