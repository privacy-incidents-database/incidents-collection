Published: August 12, 2006


WASHINGTON, Aug. 11  The Department of Homeland Security has taken significant steps since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks  to make it much harder to turn a plane into a flying weapon. But a nearly obsessive focus on the previous attacks may have prevented the federal government from combating new threats effectively,  terrorism experts and former agency officials say.

 The arrests overseas this week of people  accused of planning to use an explosive that would be undetectable at airports illustrates the significant security gaps, they said. While the department has hardened cockpit doors and set up screening for guns and knives, it  has done far too little to protect against plastic and liquid explosives, bombs in air cargo and shoulder-fired missiles, the experts say. The nation is still at risk from  the same “failure of imagination” cited by the 9/11 commission as having contributed to the success of the 2001 attack, several argued.“They are reactive, not proactive,” said Randall J. Larsen, a retired colonel in the Air Force who is chairman of the military strategy department at the National War College in Washington. Robert M. Blitzer, who served 26 years in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including as head of its counterterrorism unit, said the federal government had a serious problem because its personnel today turned over far too quickly. Mr. Blitzer, now an analyst at ICF International, in Fairfax, Va., said: “They don’t have enough continuity and knowledge to know what they’re up against. Stability is a big thing for identifying trends. It’s not easy to do. Sometimes all you have is just snippets of information.”Justin P. Oberman, a former senior policy official at the Transportation Security Administration, said the problem was not  lack of imagination but limited money available to invest in the technologies needed.“Too much is weighted toward looking for knives and guns on people coming through the checkpoint and screening every checked bag,” Mr. Oberman, who left the agency last year, said. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, in a news conference Friday, said the department was trying to stay ahead of terrorists.“We’ve spent about three-quarters of a billion dollars in research on emerging types of technologies in explosives,” Mr. Chertoff  said. “And we are constantly monitoring the world for developments that occur in the field of improvised explosive devices, precisely so we can start to work on countermeasures.”But even at senior levels of the department, there is recognition that this criticism is somewhat fair. “D.H.S. has to be nimble in a way most government agencies don’t, and that has to be baked into our very DNA,” said Michael Jackson, the deputy secretary, in an interview. “I am impatient. I don’t think we have gotten as far as we need to go. We can do more, and we can do better. And we must.” The vulnerabilities are clear. A failed plot in 1995, incubated in the Philippines, to bomb 12 United States commercial jets flying out of Asia, centered on  the use of triacetone triperoxide, or TATP, a liquid explosive that  may also have been the weapon of choice of the plotters in England. The Department of Homeland Security  has evaluated technology that it says will search an individual bottle for liquid explosives, but it cannot search all the bottles in a suitcase. It also cannot reliably detect chemicals that are not explosive but become so when mixed.  The department is still evaluating technologies for foiling shoulder-fired missiles, a favored tool of rebel groups against military aircraft. One blinds missiles with an infrared laser; another option would be a ground-based antimissile system near airports. The Transporation Security Administration has the technology to inspect small objects shipped as air cargo, but does not have the capacity to do so uniformly. Given the long list of possible threats,  and the limited budget to buy equipment to defend against them,  it is essential not just to look for threats, Mr. Larsen said, but also to evaluate each one.Mr. Oberman, the former security agency   official, said that part of the problem was the mandates imposed on the agency by Congress  like  hiring government employees to do checkpoint screening and inspecting every checked bag instead of focusing the inspections on those considered the highest risk. This results in inspection programs that are so costly there is little money available to research into new threats.When James Loy took over the security agency  in 2002, he created a special unit assigned to think like terrorists. “It was all part of staying on the edge,” he said. 12Next Page »William J.
