NEW YORK —  "Nerds," a new musical about the tech giants Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, has scuttled plans for its spring Broadway debut and plans to tour instead.Producers said Tuesday the show — originally scheduled to begin previews on April 1 at the Longacre Theatre — has had to be postponed "due to the loss of a major investor."The show features book and lyrics by Jordan Allen-Dutton and Erik Weiner Adult Swim's animated "Robot Chicken") and music by Hal Goldberg. Casey Hushion was to direct and Joshua Bergasse was slated to choreograph."Nerds" was first presented at the New York Musical Theatre Festival and later at Philadelphia Theatre Company and North Carolina Theatre.
