HERE is the way flying is now: This is illegal! the airport screener barked at Zelda R. Stern. He was holding up a container of cottage cheese he had spotted in her carry-on.My hunch that no one had previously uttered those words to Ms. Stern in her life turned out to be true. I always toe the line, Ms. Stern said firmly as she  recalled  being  done in by cottage cheese last month at the security checkpoint at Newark Liberty International Airport as she and her husband, Stanley Rosenzweig, were flying to San Diego.Ms. Stern pointed to a row of chairs where passengers often sit, just past the checkpoint, to put their shoes back on.  Do you mind if I could just sit and eat my cottage cheese right there? You can watch me there, she said. Absolutely not, the screener replied. The only option was to go back out of the security zone, get back in the long line, and eat the cottage cheese as she waited to clear the checkpoint once more. That is what she did. I thought to myself, this is not a very good use of security personnel, she said.  I really was hungry. My husband and I keep kosher, and  who knows what they give you to eat on a plane. But this man took me all the way out of security and made sure I stayed back there to eat my cottage cheese.Ms. Stern said that she and her husband were sticklers for preparing carefully before travel and  following the rules. They take liquids and gels like shampoo and toothpaste in containers of three ounces or less, and pack them neatly for inspection in regulation quart-size zipper-lock baggies. Carry-on bags are also neatly packed for display.  I am very careful about the baggie and the three-ounce containers, she said.  I thought I was up to spec, totally, said Ms. Stern, who lives in Manhattan.Well, not so fast, sister. It so happens that the Transportation Security Administration does have a paragraph arguably addressing Ms. Sterns cottage cheese on its always amusing Prohibited Items list. Sure, no meat cleavers, swords or baseball bats in carry-on bags. But also, you may carry on no substances like   soup, sauces, peanut butter, fruits, vegetables and jellies unless they are in containers of three ounces or less. If I were a prosecutor, Id argue that   cottage cheese is excluded from the list of things permitted under that regulation. And I thought I was a model flier, Ms. Stern said ruefully.And then here is flying the way it used to be. It used to be fun! said Donald Bain, a  writer and airline enthusiast. Mr. Bain, himself a former airline executive, has written 90 books, including the  Murder, She Wrote mystery series and the landmark   Coffee, Tea or Me? in 1967, the supposed memoir of two sexy globe-trotting stewardesses that many older flight attendants have told me was their inspiration for applying for airline jobs when they were in their 20s. Coffee, Tea or Me? sprang from a publishers idea to have two actual stewardesses write about their exploits. But when their anecdotes turned up to be worth about 20 pages, Mr. Bain was called in to  well, he mostly made up the book. The stewardesses whose names appeared as authors did the books publicity, and not until many years and many books later did Mr. Bain admit to being the actual author. Heres an example of how things have changed, he said.  About 10 years ago we were coming up on the 30th anniversary of  Coffee, Tea or Me? and hoping to get it republished. And publishers responses were unanimous. They said flying is just not fun anymore. And that was pre-9/11, pre-security craziness  but they were right.Mr. Bain has a new book out, a memoir called  Murder He Wrote: A Successful Writers Life (Purdue University Press).He isnt looking forward to traveling to promote it.  I find myself just not wanting to fly, even though I have to, he said.But he does fondly recall the old flying days, back when  Coffee, Tea or Me? expressed the sheer joy of life in the air.He said:  Once, when the book was still famous, I was sitting next to a guy on a plane who asked the stewardess if she had read it and if she knew that it was actually written by a guy. So Im kind of all ears. And the stewardess, who I had never seen before, said,  Yes! As a matter of fact I met the guy who actually wrote it on a flight last week. He said Im going to be in the sequel! Were having dinner next week. Guaranteed, cottage cheese wasnt on the menu.E-mail: sharkeyj@nytimes.com
