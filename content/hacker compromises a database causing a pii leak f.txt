The OAIC will publish a further statement at the conclusion of its investigation,” an OAIC statement said.At the time, iiNet CIO Matthew Toohey said that the company was investigating the matter and that the incident had been reported to law enforcement agencies.“iiNet is aware of an incident that may have resulted in unauthorised access to old customer information stored on a legacy Westnet system. Customer username, address, telephone and, in some cases, password information may have been accessed, however, no payment details were stored on the server.
