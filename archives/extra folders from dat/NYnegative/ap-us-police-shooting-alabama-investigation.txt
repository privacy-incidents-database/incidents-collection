Montgomery, Alabama, officials are planning a separate review of the fatal shooting of an unarmed man by a police officer who has been charged with murder.Mayor Todd Strange was quoted by The Montgomery Advertiser (http://on.mgmadv.com/1QAJLn5) as saying that officers are upset over Aaron Smith's arrest.Smith is charged with murder in the death of 58-year old Gregory Gunn. Gunn is black; Smith is white. Smith's attorney called his arrest a "political witch hunt."Strange says the office of City Investigations will review evidence including radio calls and witness statements, but will not have access to video footage. The department is similar to the police department's internal affairs unit.Gunn was shot Feb. 25 as he walked home from a friend's house. Police have said Smith thought Gunn looked "suspicious."___Information from: Montgomery Advertiser, http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com
