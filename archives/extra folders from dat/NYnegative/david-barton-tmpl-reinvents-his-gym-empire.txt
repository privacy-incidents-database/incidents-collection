Fashion & Style|David Barton Reinvents His Gym Empire
David Barton inside his new gym, TMPL, in Hells Kitchen.
Im dressed for a construction site, so pardon my casual presentation, David Barton said one recent Friday afternoon in Hells Kitchen. But his appearance was classic Barton: ripped jeans, mesh hoodie that exposed his George of the Jungle pecs, camouflage robe, hair spiking every which way.
And muscles. Lots of muscles.As he spoke, the sinews of his neck occasionally twitched, making his squarish frame seem like a TNT box about to detonate. At 51, the man who built a sweaty, sexy gym empire stands as a 5-foot-5 testament to body worship as urban religion.So its no surprise that his new gym, TMPL, has a name that evokes a pagan ritual crossed with an iPhone app. (His 21-year-old son, Bailey, came up with the name Temple, but I decided to lose the vowels to make it more modern, he said. )
Set to open March 23 on West 49th Street, the fitness center is his first since leaving his namesake company under a financial cloud. I like that my names not on the door, he said. But there wasnt much of a choice. When Mr. Barton left David Barton Gym in 2013, he forfeited the rights to his name after spending two decades making it synonymous with a gym-as-nightclub aesthetic.

Known for their mood lighting, live D.J.s and celebrity clients like Anderson Cooper, Zoe Saldana and Marc Jacobs, Mr. Bartons gyms ushered in an era of see-and-be-seen fitness. Drag queens worked out in platform heels. Locker rooms doubled as hookup joints. (I do like to feel like Im the godfather of many a relationship, Mr. Barton said cheekily.)As beefy impresario, Mr. Barton was often said to be a better mascot than manager. In early 2011, saddled with more than $65 million in debt, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, even as three locations were being built. Both he and the company say the breakup was mutual. Id been there 20 years, Mr. Barton said. It was time. I didnt enjoy being the corporate C.E.O.His resurgence, which comes, fittingly, on the heels of Rocky Balboas, is as attuned to the moment as his Chelsea and Astor Place locations were to the downtown party scene they mirrored. The largely gay crowd that flocked to David Barton Gym has migrated to Hells Kitchen.TMPL is also being billed as a smart gym: high-tech and customizable, like a self-parking car (or a hookup app like Grindr). Publicity materials even borrow the jargon of Silicon Valley, touting Mr. Barton as a disrupter and visionary within the gym industry.Capitalizing on the rise of celebrity trainers and personalized medicine, Mr. Barton worked with the clinical pharmacist and author James LaValle to develop a metabolic assessment for incoming gym members so that all will get individually tailored workout and nutritional plans.Everything in our lives is getting smart except the gym, he said. My phone knows when Im hungry and it calls my mother.

Mr. Barton, who studied nutrition and psychology at Cornell, is accustomed to combining brains and brawn. For all his downtown high jinks, David is quite serious in many ways, said William Sofield of the design firm Studio Sofield, which worked on TMPL and several David Barton Gym sites. David at heart is very much an intellectual bordering on almost a nerd. He could have easily been cast on The Big Bang Theory.
TMPL occupies a beige-and-salmon-brick building at One Worldwide Plaza that formerly housed a Bally Sports Club  just the sort of fluorescent-lit fitness chain that Mr. Barton made a career of disrupting.Amid the roar of electric saws, he led a brief tour of the 40,000-square-foot space, describing the constructivist dcor to come: concrete walls swathed in cashmere curtains, black-mirror columns and Eileen Gray Bibendum chairs, all in muted and muddy tones, like those colors that dont really have a name.He descended a staircase into a tall atrium, which will be glammed up with programmable lighting. This is your first sort of money shot, he said. A lot of gyms do lighting and its like when you open up the refrigerator in the middle of the night.He pointed out a future cardio room, a squat-rack room (a lot of women now are squatting because of, like, social media) and a spinning room that will immerse patrons in an IMAX-like virtual landscape.And then there are the sexier elements: an 82-foot saltwater pool and locker rooms that Mr. Barton promised would get darker, with more dramatic lighting.

But he played down his reputation for creating gyms that resemble nightclubs. David Barton Gym was me at 27, he said, and this is me at 51.Part of Mr. Bartons post-50 life is his return to semi-singlehood.For years, he and Susanne Bartsch, the Swiss party hostess, represented one of New Yorks most outr power couples. With her outrageous wigs and his outrageous biceps, they were like a punked-out Boris and Natasha. Known for her Dionysian blowouts at the Copacabana in the 1980s, Ms. Bartsch took time off to raise Bailey before resuming her role as a bedazzled queen of the night.But the marriage frayed along with Mr. Bartons balance sheet. Ms. Bartsch remained in her opium-den-like quarters at the Chelsea Hotel, while Mr. Barton moved to an apartment nearby. They never bothered divorcing. The couple are now 99 percent separated, Mr. Barton said, adding that TMPLs opening party on March 22 will be a Bartsch affair.Otherwise, Mr. Bartons not-quite-bachelor lifestyle is big on work and low on thrills, he said. He plays the drums with his electro-rock band, Liquid Blonde, spends time with his and Ms. Bartschs beloved schnauzer, Bippy, and visits his 82-year-old mother, who lives a few blocks away.After the tour, Mr. Barton crossed the plaza to a Mexican restaurant and ordered an iced tea. The traces of his past lives, romantic and professional, may be strewn around Manhattan like so many discarded gym clothes after a workout, but he seemed chipper.Im stronger than I was at 30, he said. I get out of bed in the morning, I look in the mirror, and Im happy Im David Barton.
