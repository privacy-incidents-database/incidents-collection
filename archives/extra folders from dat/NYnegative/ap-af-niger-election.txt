He was due to face the second-place finisher, Hama Amadou, on March 20.But the opposition coalition announced Tuesday night that Amadou would not participate. A coalition statement alleged that the Constitutional Court responsible for validating election results is working with the current government to ensure Issoufou gets a second term.Niger, one of the world's poorest countries, hosts French forces and American drones to combat the threat posed by Islamic extremists in West Africa.
