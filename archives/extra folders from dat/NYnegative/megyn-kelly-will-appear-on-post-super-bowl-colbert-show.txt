Megyn Kelly Will Appear on Post-Super Bowl Colbert Show
Megyn Kelly served as a moderator at a Republican presidential primary debate last week in Des Moines.
CBS announced on Monday that Stephen Colbert had added Megyn Kelly to his list of guests for a special edition of his show that will air in the valuable post-Super Bowl slot on Sunday night.Ms. Kelly has been at the center of a political storm in the last week, after Donald J. Trump said that it was her questioning  which he called unfair  that prompted him to drop out of last weeks Republican presidential debate on Fox News.She has addressed the controversy, with some restraint, on her prime time show on Fox News, the second-most-viewed cable news show behind The OReilly Factor, hosted by Bill OReilly and also on Fox News.Ms. Kelly will join a lineup of guests that include Tina Fey, Margot Robbie, Will Ferrell and the comedy team Key and Peele.Mr. Colbert is the first late-night show host to get the post-Super Bowl slot, an important designation for the show, which trails NBCs TheTonight Show, with Jimmy Fallon, in the ratings.Mr. Colbert said in an interview with Adweek that he expected an audience 10 times bigger than that for his usual nightly show, The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, which averaged roughly 2.7 million viewers the week of Jan. 18.He will host the hourlong show live from the Ed Sullivan Theater, whenever CBSs postgame report is over, which should be sometime after 10 p.m.
