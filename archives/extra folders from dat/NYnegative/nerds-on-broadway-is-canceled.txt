Nerds, a musical about the rivalry between Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, has abruptly canceled its Broadway debut just weeks before it was scheduled to begin performances, citing financial troubles.Carl Levin, a producer of the show, cited the loss of a major investor in announcing the step, which he called a great disappointment. He called the move a postponement, but did not announce a date for a Broadway staging, and said the production was now planning a national tour.Some theater industry officials have suggested in recent days that Nerds, which has been in development for several years, had opted to move to Broadway prematurely, before it had its casting completed and its financing fully in place, because the producers were offered a theater in a market where theater availability is limited.The show, with music by Hal Goldberg and book and lyrics by Jordan Allen-Dutton and Erik Weiner, was scheduled to begin previews April 1 and to open April 21 at the Longacre Theater. The show was to be directed by Casey Hushion, and to star Rory OMalley (The Book of Mormon) as Mr. Gates and Bryan Fenkart (Memphis) as Mr. Jobs.Nerds had developmental productions at the New York Musical Theater Festival, the Philadelphia Theater Company and the North Carolina Theater.
