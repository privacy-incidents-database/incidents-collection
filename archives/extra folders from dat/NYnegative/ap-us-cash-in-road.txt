A suburban Philadelphia transit worker has found a bag loaded with over $15,000 in the middle of a road and turned it in to police.The Philadelphia Inquirer reports (http://bit.ly/1M4YTF6 ) that Bob Tracey was driving home from work Monday night when he spotted the black bag.Tracey says he thought it was a purse. But when he opened it, he saw dozens of crisp $100 and $20 bills.The 61-year-old Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority worker immediately called police.Upper Darby Superintendent of Police Michael Chitwood says "to turn that kind of cash in" makes Tracey "truly a good Samaritan."It's unclear who lost the money.Tracey says his wife assured him he did the right thing, even though he was $15,000 richer "for about a half hour."___This story has been corrected to show the transit worker's last name is Tracey, not Stacey.
