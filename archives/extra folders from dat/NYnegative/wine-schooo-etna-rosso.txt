In Etna Rosso, a Delicious Tension Between Sweet and Bitter
No grape more than nerello mascalese illustrates the profound changes that have transformed the world of wine in the last 25 years.
Back then, the grape was almost universally dismissed as lacking potential. It came from an island, Sicily, that was reviled for the boatloads of bad wine it produced, and from a region, Mount Etna, that was ignored but for the hyperactive volcano that defines it.Now, Etna Rosso, a red wine made primarily of nerello mascalese, with a little help from its cousin, nerello cappuccio, is adored in wine bars and restaurants all over. It is considered one of the most exciting to have emerged on the global stage in this century.Here at Wine School, weve long acclaimed the growing diversity of grapes, places and styles as among the most thrilling pleasures wine has to offer. All it takes is an open mind and the courage to risk disappointment in the quest for new discoveries, prime virtues in our curriculum.Each month in Wine School, I recommend three bottles of a particular kind of wine for drinking over the next few weeks. As you consider the wines, I invite you to share your thoughts and insights by commenting at nytimes.com/food.Id venture to guess that few were disappointed by the Etna Rossos we have been drinking. They included the three I recommended, Tenuta Delle Terre Nere Etna Rosso 2014, Benanti Etna Rosso Rossodiverzella 2013 and Biondi Etna Rosso Outis 2013, along with other Etna Rossos that you brought to the conversation.Possibly this was because Etna Rossos touch on many of the characteristics that classically define most red wines from Italy, bringing together these qualities in a particularly distinctive way.They are fragrant with the aromas of fruit and earth. The flavors suggest both sweetness and bitterness without actually achieving either. Yet in this tension between the two comes a thrilling ability to quench, intrigue, refresh and invite another sip. Structure comes from a combination of tannins and acidity, with the acidity playing a more prominent role than, say, with French reds. And they are transparent, with the best versions able to convey incremental differences in terroir.

Wine School: Your Next Lesson: Etna RossoJAN. 28, 2016
The three bottles I chose were all entry-level wines, generally produced in quantity, often from the youngest vines or least-prized parts of the vineyard. They also require the least amount of aging, which makes them more immediately accessible than bottles that may have greater potential but would not be as enjoyable for a few years.
Even so, these wines gave a distinct suggestion of whats possible in better versions, which Id encourage seeking out if you liked these. Almost everybody noted the earthy minerality that is a distinct component of nerello mascalese grown in the volcanic soils of Etna. For me, these wines each displayed the elemental tang of iron, which one reader, Martin Schappeit of Amherst, Va., communicated with graphic eloquence.Like the blood of a dead animal, he wrote of the Biondi. This wine was dark, earthy, mysterious, fascinating.

JKM of Washington, D.C., noted a peculiar earthiness that I will guess is related to the volcanic upbringing of these wines, while Bailey Hoffner of Norman, Okla., found a musty depth to the aromas of a 2005 Calabretta, coincidentally one of my favorite Etna producers. Ali of New York sensed in the Biondi ashy ground, earth, animal barn and white vinegar.Now, I will say that Alis reference to white vinegar threw me for a moment. No wine producer would ever want vinegar to be associated with a wine; it generally indicates spoilage and would indeed be a flaw. But her use of the word came in an otherwise positive description.Returning to the wine, I could see what she meant. It had a savory, herbal element that combined with the lively acidity may be reminiscent of a, ahem, very good vinegar, which has a tart tang that is a long way from the acrid industrial versions.
Otherwise, I found the Biondi to be a typical example of an Etna Rosso, with earthy, tart flavors of sour cherries, a lean, graceful texture and a tight, focused aftertaste that fused fruitiness with a hint of bitterness.All of these qualities were even more expressive in the Benanti, which seemed bright, fresh and almost nervous with flavors of tart cherries and herbs, an earthy, yes, bloody iron edge and that finishing twist of fruit and bitterness, setting up the mouth for another sip.
Eric Asimov, The New York Times wine critic, is talking about Etna Rosso this month.If you would like to join the conversation, try one of the bottleslisted here and as you try them, ask yourself these questions.
These wines are naturally high in acid. How do they feel in the mouth?
Be general rather than specific. Sweet and fruited? Bitter? Savory? All of those?
By contrast, the Terre Nere seemed quite different. The flavors of tart cherry, earth and balsamic vinegar (I said it) were similar. But both aromatically and on the palate, it seemed more forward and yet more tannic, which was not surprising as it was a year younger than the other bottles.
Interestingly, Cathy Corison, the great Napa wine producer, speculated on Twitter that perhaps the winemaker had used some carbonic maceration, an increasingly popular technique around the world that is most often identified with Beaujolais, and can be associated with an attractive, spicy, fruity quality. I checked with the Terre Nere proprietor, Marco de Grazia, who said the wine was made in the more conventional way, with no carbonic maceration. I could understand why Ms. Corison might have thought that, though.
One of the things I like best about these Etna Rossos is the elusive nature of their flavors. This quality is expressed especially in the almost electric push-pull between sweetness and bitterness, a balance that creates intrigue. Many readers noticed this as well and grappled for words to describe it.Not sweet, but theres something, Masahiro Hosokawa of Tokyo wrote. Max D. of Michigan said, It has fruit, but Id hardly call it sweet, while Ferguson wrote, They were slightly sweet and fruited but savory too and no bitterness.I suggest that the wines do, in fact, have suggestions of bitterness, but that people are often reluctant to use the term because it has a negative connotation. It should not. Bitterness, as long as it is in balance, can be pleasant and refreshing and is an essential element in many great red wines. Unfortunately, modern marketing infantilizes its audience by seizing the connotations of sweetness and fruitiness and rejecting flavors that may be perceived as green or bitter. My advice: embrace the bitterness.Many readers said these wines reminded them of pinot noirs (perhaps the taste of Marsannay was fresh in the mouth) or cru Beaujolais. I can see why. Both of these wines also show a fine balance between sweet and bitter with the addition of earthy mineral flavors, and each can be focused and graceful like the better Etna Rossos.
I would say they are also reminiscent of Chianti Classicos, which show a dusty tannic quality along with a more pronounced acidity than the French wines. Somewhere in the mix lie the Etna Rossos.One reader, Sherri Morano of Durham, N.C., who is a Master of Wine and works with Wine Ring, an interesting new wine-buying aid, lamented the comparisons. Id like to encourage wine lovers to assess nerello on its own terms as I worry comparisons wont fully convey its unique character, she wrote.Fair enough. Yet often such comparisons help place wines in a constellation of known quantities, which can serve as a useful mnemonic device. Imperfect, perhaps, but, as sommeliers and wine merchants know, practical.
