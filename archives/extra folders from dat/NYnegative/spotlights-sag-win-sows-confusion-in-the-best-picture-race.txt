At this stage of the game, if they dont go on to win Oscars, many hats with be eaten en masse.The belle of the ball, Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl), landed best supporting actress, making her Academy prospects rosier than ever.

Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Elba said, at one point, from the stage, standing alongside his Beasts of No Nation co-star Abraham Attah, Welcome to diverse TV.Indeed Queen Latifah, Uzo Aduba and Viola Davis all walked away with SAGs for performances on the small screen. Mr. Elba did especially, swimmingly Saturday night, taking home a second SAG for his lead performance in the BBCs Luther.But as for the almighty best picture race at the Oscars, it now stands, more than ever, as exactly that: a race, because the signs are pointing all over the place.The Golden Globes split the baby between The Revenant for best drama and The Martian for best comedy. The Producers Guild anointed The Big Short. On Saturday, SAG-AFTRA  which has some 160,000 members  gave Spotlight its best ensemble prize. A day earlier, the American Cinema Editors  whose awards are closely watched, because their best dramatic film picks usually go on to win best picture  named Mad Max: Fury Road as the years best drama and The Big Short, for comedy.So all that can be said with certainty at this point is that the Oscar for best picture is assuredly going to a movie about a guy or a bunch of guys on a mission (perhaps with a lady thrown in, too).
