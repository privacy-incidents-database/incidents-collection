The Denver Broncos released three players who helped them win the Super Bowl: tight end Owen Daniels, guard Louis Vasquez, and long snapper Aaron Brewer.Denver is trying to clear salary cap space to re-sign some of its key free agents, including Super Bowl MVP Von Miller, who received the franchise tag. With Peyton Manning retiring, the Broncos also need a starting quarterback and Brock Osweiler is a free agent.Broncos general manager John Elway said Tuesday: "These decisions are never easy, but we appreciate the contributions Louis, Owen and Aaron made to our team, especially during our Super Bowl run."Vasquez started all but one regular-season game in the last three seasons and all seven postseason matches. Daniels, signed by Denver as an unrestricted free agent from Baltimore last year, ranked third on the Broncos in receptions (46), receiving yards (517) and receiving touchdowns (3) during 2015.______
