Some analysts were concerned that the acquisition of Alere could weigh on Abbotts growth. In the 12 months through December, Aleres revenue declined 3.6 percent, according to estimates compiled by Standard & Poors Capital IQ, while Abbotts increased 0.8 percent over that same period.Abbott will pay $56 a common share of Alere, and it will assume, or refinance, $2.6 billion of Aleres net debt. Abbott also plans to finance the deal with debt, Brian J. Blaser, the executive vice president of diagnostics products at Abbott, said on the companys conference call on Monday.The offer represents a premium of more than 50 percent over Aleres closing stock price on Friday, and its shares were up 45 percent in morning trading on Monday.Thomas C. Freyman, Abbotts executive vice president of finance and administration, said on the call that the process for acquiring Alere was competitive. It was the fair premium and the strategic fit that allowed Abbott to prevail, he said.Other potential bidders before Mondays deal announcement may have been private equity firms or the Danaher Corporation, Mark Massaro, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, said in a note on Monday. Its unlikely that other bidders will enter the fray at such a high premium, he said.Point-of-care tests represented about 10 percent of Abbotts total diagnostic sales of $4.6 billion last year. In addition to diagnostics, Abbott also makes medical devices, nutritionals and generic pharmaceuticals.The transaction will be accretive to Abbotts earnings per share when the deal closes, and is expected to add about 12 to 13 cents in 2017 and more than 20 cents per share in 2018. The combined company is expecting to extract $500 million in synergies by 2019 through sales and operational benefits.Medical testing was not the only health care sector to have a deal announced Monday. The Stryker Corporation agreed to acquire Sage Products, which makes products for the intensive-care unit, from the private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners for $2.8 billion in cash.As a result of the deal, which the company said was accretive, Stryker raised its full-year 2016 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.05 per share to a range of $5.55 to $5.75 per share.Evercore is providing financial advice to Abbott, while JPMorgan Chase is working with Alere.
