The man who allegedly handled finances for a far-reaching corruption scheme in Guatemala has testified that the then-vice president's right-hand man told him that bribes were going to his boss and the president.Salvador Estuardo Gonzalez Alvarez appeared to tie together various actors in the scam, in which importers paid bribes rather than import taxes.Gonzalez said Tuesday he was told to pass bribes he received to Juan Carlos Monzon, private secretary to then vice-president Roxana Baldetti. He said Monzon told Gonzalez that the money was for Baldetti and then-President Otto Perez Molina.Gonzalez said half of the money received was designated for Baldetti and Perez Molina.More than 100 people have been tied to the scam and at least 30 are jailed, including Baldetti and Perez Molina.
