One team source told ESPN that Manziel had been drunk off his ass.
I brought this on myself, Manziel said after the Browns final game of the season. I brought these cameras and all these people that are in this locker room right now and I dont think its fair to myself, I dont think its fair to anybody in this locker room the distractions Ive brought at points in time.
The Browns said on Monday that they supported Manziels decision to enter rehab. we fully support Johnnys initiative in this decision, and will fully support him through this process, said the Browns general manager, Ray Farmer. Our players health and well-being will always be of the utmost importance to the Cleveland Browns.
Manziels failed to impress in his first NFL season. After a brilliant college career, he was drafted in the first round by the Browns. However, he saw limited playing time and threw two interceptions and no touchdowns, completing just 51.4% of his passes.
