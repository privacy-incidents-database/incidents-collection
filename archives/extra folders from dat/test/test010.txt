Business Day|Mark Zuckerbergs Most Valuable Friend
PALO ALTO, Calif.EVERY Monday a bit before 10 a.m., Sheryl Sandberg, Facebooks chief operating officer, dashes off a quick e-mail to her boss, Mark Zuckerberg. We have a routine, Ms. Sandberg says. I e-mail, Coming in? He replies, On my way.A few minutes later, Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebooks co-founder and chief executive, walks into the companys headquarters here, says a few hellos and heads to a conference room where he and Ms. Sandberg huddle for an hour. The two executives end the week the same way, with a closed-door meeting on Friday afternoon. They discuss products, strategy, deals, personnel  and each other.We agreed that we would give each other feedback every Friday, Ms. Sandberg says. We are constantly flagging things. Nothing ever builds up. At a recent meeting, for instance, they ironed out a disagreement between them over the details of Mr. Zuckerbergs pledge to give $100 million to schools in Newark.If all of that sounds a bit touchy-feely, well, it is. Ms. Sandberg, a well-regarded Internet executive, is known for her interpersonal skills as much as for her sharp intellect. And her regular meetings with the famously introverted Mr. Zuckerberg have helped to keep one of Silicon Valleys most unusual business partnerships working wonders for Facebook.Indeed, for a variety of reasons, Ms. Sandberg may well have become Mr. Zuckerbergs most valuable friend.
Since Ms. Sandberg joined the company more than two years ago, Facebook has successfully navigated one of the more perilous stages in a start-ups life: a period of hypergrowth. Facebooks work force has expanded sixfold, to nearly 1,800, and its global audience has multiplied by more than seven, to half a billion. Revenue, once little more than an afterthought, is expected to balloon to around $1.6 billion this year,
according to estimates from Wedbush Securities. (Facebook, a private company, doesnt disclose its revenue.)Part of the reason for that sales growth is Ms. Sandbergs close ties to many of the worlds largest advertisers, relationships she first developed as a senior executive at Google. Ms. Sandberg also brought stability to Facebook, which had suffered from a long period of turmoil and the departure of several executives and early employees, including the companys other co-founders.One of the reasons the company is doing so well is because the two of them get along so well, says Mike Schroepfer, vice president for engineering.Ms. Sandberg
has focused on building the business, expanding internationally, cultivating relationships with large advertisers and putting her polish on things like communications and public policy. That has freed Mr. Zuckerberg to focus on what he likes best: the Facebook Web site and its platform.Donald Graham, the chairman of the Washington Post Company, who once tried to hire Ms. Sandberg, says that in the last two years a lot of questions about Facebooks viability have been put to rest.The combination of Mark and Sheryl is the primary reason, says Mr. Graham, who is also a member of Facebooks board.These days, Ms. Sandberg is also juggling another duty: mounting a defense of Mr. Zuckerberg at a time when a new movie, The Social Network, portrays him as an aloof and conniving student who may have stolen the idea for Facebook from others. Ms. Sandberg will have none of that.He is shy and introverted and he often does not seem very warm to people who dont know him, but he is warm, Ms. Sandberg says of Mr. Zuckerberg, her voice rising with empathy. He really cares about the people who work here.
She can be just as protective of Mr. Zuckerberg in private.At a technology conference this summer, for instance, Mr. Zuckerberg flopped during an onstage interview. He gave rambling answers to questions about Facebooks privacy policies, became visibly nervous and started sweating profusely. After the interview, Ms. Sandberg encouraged him not to beat himself up over it, but to focus on parts of the interview that went well so he could do better next time, according to people briefed on their interaction who didnt want to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.
Sheryl Sandberg is credited with helping to guide the growth of Facebook  and her boss.
She really wants him to succeed, says one of these people.For all her achievements, theres one area where Ms. Sandbergs influence has yet to work its magic: privacy concerns. While Ms. Sandberg is not ultimately responsible for the features on the Facebook site  thats Mr. Zuckerbergs job  she is deeply involved in the planning that revolves around them. She readily acknowledges that Facebook has made mistakes.It is completely fair to say that we have had our challenges around privacy, she says.Ms. Sandberg says that Facebook built powerful privacy controls, but that they became too complicated for the average user. Facebook recently simplified those settings. Mark took the step to apologize, about the privacy problems, she notes.But some critics say the privacy issue goes beyond how easily users understand Facebooks settings. For example, they note, Facebook collects increasing amounts of personal information from users to help marketers fine-tune their messages.I fear that Ms. Sandberg is failing to provide the adult supervision that Facebook requires, says Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, an advocacy group based in Washington. Facebooks direction regarding its use of its member data, and the viral and largely stealth marketing practices it endorses, is very disturbing. Continue reading the main story
A spokesman for Facebook said the site lets users control what information they want to share and with whom, and makes it clear how the information may be used in its advertising products. Facebook never sells that information to third parties, the spokesman said.MARK ZUCKERBERG and Sheryl Sandberg may well be Silicon Valleys oddest couple.Mr. Zuckerberg, a 26-year-old engineer and product visionary, is socially awkward and reserved. At 41, Ms. Sandberg is the opposite: polished, personable, chatty and at ease in the limelight.The differences dont end there. Mr. Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard after his sophomore year to focus on building Facebook, and has never worked anywhere else. Ms. Sandberg, who has a Harvard M.B.A., is a veteran of Google, where she had a central role in building the largest, most successful advertising business on the Internet.
By the time she left Google, her unit had grown from a handful of people to about 4,000 employees, or about one-quarter of Googles total, and it accounted for more than half
of the companys revenue. She also helped to establish Googles philanthropic arm and ran operations for a collection of unrelated projects, like Googles book-scanning operations.Eric Schmidt, Googles chief executive, says he considers Ms. Sandberg to be a superstar. But there is growing tension between the two companies, in part because Ms. Sandberg has recruited a string of former Google executives and employees. About 200 ex-Googlers are now working at Facebook.Before coming to Silicon Valley in 2001, Ms. Sandberg earned a degree in economics and then her M.B.A. from Harvard, did stints at the World Bank and at McKinsey & Company, and then worked as chief of staff for Lawrence H. Summers when he was Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration.Despite their obvious differences  or maybe because of them  Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg have grown close. A lot of people choose to hire people who look exactly like them, Mr. Zuckerberg says. Here we just value balance a lot more. It takes work to build those relationships, but if it does work, you end up with a much better system.Mr. Zuckerberg met Ms. Sandberg at a Christmas party in 2007, and they immediately took a liking to each other. What followed was an intense, six-week business courtship, during which the two dined together multiple times a week. Because both of them are Silicon Valley celebrities, they typically ate at Ms. Sandbergs house so they could keep their talks confidential.We were very methodical and thoughtful about the relationship, says Ms. Sandberg.For his part, Mr. Zuckerberg, ever the tech geek, describes their interactions as high-bandwidth.We can talk for 30 seconds and have more meaning be exchanged than in a lot of meetings that I have for an hour, he says. Ms. Sandberg might give him a quick update on, say, the development of Facebooks offices in Ireland or India.I make sure that I understand the basic things that we are doing, says Mr. Zuckerberg. But, he adds, he trusts that anything Ms. Sandberg handles will run smoothly. The dynamic on the management team, he says, has improved a huge amount since she joined.

Outside the company, Ms. Sandberg spends much of her time with advertisers. Last week,
for example, she crisscrossed Manhattan, where she gave a keynote speech at an Advertising Week conference and met in private with various large advertisers.
Ms. Sandberg also oversees the seemingly arcane operational details that can help a company run smoothly  especially a company that is growing rapidly.She recently sat down with Pedram Keyani, an engineer whose team builds the tools that handle complaints and requests from Facebooks users. Mr. Keyani said Ms. Sandberg met with his small group to understand the challenges it faced, and later reorganized it to run more smoothly.She operates at every level, Mr. Keyani says. Shes good at strategy and dives deep and understands how teams work together.THE embrace of Ms. Sandberg by Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebooks 20-something rank-and-file was not preordained. When she was hired, a frat-house atmosphere permeated the company, according to many early employees, and technology blogs speculated that she had been brought in to clean up the place.To this day, Ms. Sandberg looks a bit out of place at Facebook. She sits in a cluster of desks that includes Mr. Zuckerbergs as well as those of other engineering and product executives. Their penchant for jeans, T-shirts and hoodies is in sharp contrast to her taste for elegant clothing. Her own staff, which handles most of Facebooks business functions, works in another building a few blocks away.Her efforts to win over the Facebook troops began on her first day. She went desk to desk to introduce herself, cracking jokes and asking questions. It had the desired effect.Shes legit, says Christopher Cox, a confidant of Mr. Zuckerberg and the companys vice president for product. Shes not like a robot M.B.A. The people who get rejected here are the people who come here and say all these M.B.A. words like synergy.
Ms. Sandberg earned a reputation for mentoring many younger employees  especially women, encouraging many of them not to shy away from important roles simply because they were planning to start families. Ms. Sandberg can speak to that topic from experience: she is married to Dave Goldberg, the chief executive of SurveyMonkey, a maker of software for online surveys, and the couple have two young children.Whenever anyone on her side of the company is promoted, she sends a
congratulatory note.People who have known Ms. Sandberg a long time say they are not surprised by her success. As a Harvard undergraduate, she sat near the back of an economics class taught by Mr. Summers. He says he didnt pay much attention to her until she turned in the best midterm examination in her class  and then the best final.Mr. Summers became her thesis adviser and later hired her to work with him at the World Bank and at the Treasury Department. Although she was still in her 20s, she played pivotal roles, like helping ramp up aid efforts to Africa by opening Treasurys door to Bono of U2.I had never heard of him and said to Sheryl that I only meet with people who have a first name and last name, Mr. Summers recalls. At Ms. Sandbergs urging, he finally agreed. Debt relief in Africa wouldnt have happened if she hadnt insisted I meet Bono and persevered on this issue, says Mr. Summers.MS. SANDBERGS connection with Mr. Zuckerberg runs especially deep. The two often socialize, and Mr. Zuckerberg, who was captain of his high school fencing team, has taught Ms. Sandbergs 5-year-old son a few fencing moves.When Mr. Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, his longtime girlfriend, started thinking about philanthropy, they turned to Ms. Sandberg. She immediately tapped her vast network of contacts and organized meetings with the likes of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Michelle A. Rhee, the schools chief in Washington, D.C.Ms. Sandberg helped me navigate the politics of it and to figure out where I could have the most leverage, Mr. Zuckerberg says. That she was the person that Priscilla and I turned to is a strong symbol of our relationship.
