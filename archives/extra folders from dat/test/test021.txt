"IT JUST goes to show how easy it is to exploit Humberside Police's security procedures."	Those are the words of the man who took pictures in the cells of Grimsby Police Station and wrote a Trip Advisor-style review of the facilities on Facebook that has since gone viral.	Humberside Police launched an urgent investigation into how Christian Willoughby smuggled a mobile phone into the cells, and is treating it as a serious "security breach".	But speaking to the Grimsby Telegraph, Mr Willoughby said the stunt was "just for a laugh" and the only reason he smuggled the phone into the cells was to "pass time".

"As far as I was concerned, this was just for a laugh. But I wasn't expecting it to go viral," he said.	"People have been sharing this all over the country and it has made people laugh. It is only harmless fun. I'm pleased people find it funny.	"The only reason I smuggled the phone into the police station was to simply pass time. No other reason.	"Then I decided to post some pictures on Facebook and write a review of the cells. This was just a bit of light-hearted banter, nothing else."	Mr Willoughby was arrested and put in the cells on Wednesday night for what he calls a "misdemeanour", but remained in good spirits.	He added: "Since I made the post, it has now gone viral and had nearly 1,500 shares in 24 hours. I'm getting messages every couple of minutes from people all over the country telling me how I've made their day and how funny it is.	"There has been hardly any negative response. I never expected it to spread on the internet like this.	"But on a serious note, it goes to show how easy it is to exploit Humberside Police's security procedures. People are constantly asking me how I managed to get the iPhone in there, but I'd rather keep them guessing."	However, he said he was happy to discuss it with police should they get in touch.	Chief Inspector James Glansfield said: "The force are aware of pictures apparently of the Grimsby Custody Suite on social media.	"These appear to have been taken by a prisoner while in custody on Wednesday, March 9.	"We take any such breach of security and detainee safety extremely seriously and will be carrying out a review of our detainee management to identify any lessons learned and prevent further reoccurrences in the future.	"The force's Professional Standards Branch are investigating the circumstances of the incident."More of today's Grimsby newsFollow us on Facebook and Twitter

He should start a career reviewing hotels, I thought it was quite a clever & witty piece given the circumstances! No harm was done so let it lie.
