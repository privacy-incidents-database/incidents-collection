Hamas leader says Palestinian Authority, Israel unable to stop 'intifada'
Israeli security forces detainedthree Palestinians who illegally entered the country on Saturday morning in an attempt to find work following initialreports that they intended to carry out a terror attack.
After conducting searches in communities near the Gaza border, Israeli security forcesfound the three Palestinian labor migrants and took them into custody.
Earlier, the residents of a community in southern Israel were instructed by security officials to remain at home after reports of a suspected breach of the Gaza border.
The Israeli military searchedthe area of the Eshkol Regional Council after footsteps were found near the border fence.
Roads in the area were closed and security forces were on high alert after reports of potential Palestinian infiltrators from the coastal enclave.
Meanwhile, Hamas's leader in Gaza Ismail Haniyeh said Friday that both Israel and the Palestinian Authority are powerless to stop the current intifada, which has seen a series of mainly lone-wolf attacks being carried out by Palestinians against Israelis.
The intifada will continue and will become the greatest strategic turning point in the history of the Palestinian struggle, Haniyeh, according to Channel 2 television, as reported by the Times of Israel.
Speaking at anti-Israel rally in the southern Gaza town of Rafah, Haniyeh warned that "nothing will be able to stop this intifada. Not the occupying enemy and nor its security cooperation with the Palestinian Authority."
A wave of Palestinian knife, gun and car-ramming assaults that erupted in October has claimed the lives of over 30 Israelis, as well as an American, a Sudanese and an Eritrean.
The violence has also seen 176 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces, most while carrying out attacks but others during clashes and demonstrations.
Earlier this month Hamas called on Palestinians to carry out suicide bombings against Israeli civilians, in particular on public transport.
"It's not a real intifada until the roofs of Israeli buses don't start flying," the group said in a video clip, referring to earlier terror waves defined by suicide bombings, including in the mid 1990s and the Second Intifada in the early years of the last decade.
The song also urged Palestinians to "humble" Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The clip's release coincided with a new survey conducted among the Palestinian public revealing a significant drop in support for the current uprising.
A report by the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor documented 1,391 cases of Palestinians arbitrarily arrested by the two Palestinian parties, Fatah and Hamas, in 2015.
Systematic torture in Palestinian prisons in the West Bank and Gaza Strip was documented in the report -- at least 179 cases of torture in Palestinian Authority (PA) prisons in 2015.
The PA security forces are trained and funded by several Western countries, including the US. This establishes a direct line between these Western donors and the arbitrary arrests, torture and human rights violations that have become the norm in PA-controlled prisons and detention centers.
The report also revealed that the Palestinian Authority regularly disobeys court orders by refusing to release detainees, showing contempt for its courts and judges.
Before our eyes, two police states are being built: one in the West Bank and a second in the Gaza Strip -- in the face of talk by international parties of establishing an independent Palestinian state. But the last thing the Palestinians need is another police state.
