Do you believe that the best kind of neighbor is the one you can't see? Garden your way into a little privacy with these hardy plants, suggested by the landscape architect Chris Grampp and the horticulturists Bruce Crawford and Jeffrey Johnson.
WHITE FRINGETREE This small tree or large shrub could make media appearances as a lilac impersonator, said Mr. Johnson, the woody plants specialist at the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum. Its flowers are white, though, ''and kind of dangle from the tree.''
BLACK CHOKEBERRY While its orange-y fall leaves may suggest a spray-on tan, this eight-foot plant isn't a sun-glutton, Mr. Johnson added later in an e-mail message. And the ''glossy black fruit'' could stick around until winter, if peckish birds
FALSE HOLLY Smell, but don't touch. Mr. Crawford likes this ball-shaped shrub for its ''exceedingly fragrant'' late fall flowers. The half-prickly foliage makes it Bambi-resistant for the New York suburbs, but like many plants -- and people -- it can't handle a Minnesota winter.
CALIFORNIA GRAPE ''People love to plant grapes along their fences here,'' Mr. Grampp said. Vitis californica is native to the Bay Area, he said, ''where you'll have pretty full coverage'' in 18 months. But varieties of wild grape are hardy across the country.
BLACK BAMBOO For the mild West Coast, Mr. Grampp likes this ''jet-black stalk'' with ''vibrant yellow-green'' leaves. ''It looks like a famous Italian designer made the plant,'' he said. But a rubber-root barrier is the only way to keep the plant's aggressive runners from colonizing the block.
