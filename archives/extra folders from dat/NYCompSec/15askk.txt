A. Those tiny flash-memory drives that plug into a computer's U.S.B. port are great for hauling large files between computers  but can cause
worry if they get lost while storing sensitive information. Anyone who finds an unprotected portable drive could plug it into a computer and browse the files stored on it.Many new U.S.B. drives, including those made by Verbatim,
SanDisk, Kingston and Lexar, include security software to encrypt stored files, and require a password to view data on the drive. (Most of these included programs are for Windows.) If you already have a U.S.B. drive and want to keep your files safe from anyone who may accidentally stumble across it, you can find encryption programs for external and portable drives around the Web. One free option includes TrueCrypt (www.truecrypt.org) for Windows and Linux systems, and there are plenty of commercial programs available. VersionTracker (www.versiontracker.com), a site that lists thousands of programs and software updates for Windows, Macintosh and Palm hand-held systems, also has plenty of file-encryption and data-security programs to browse.Jabbering Away With I.M.Q. What is Jabber?A. Jabber, a technology first developed in 1998, enables compatible software programs to exchange instant messages over the Internet. Unlike AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), MSN Messenger or other software products that don't let users poke around in the programming, Jabber's programming code is open source  which means that anyone can see inside the software and improve it. Google Talk, an instant-message and audio chat service, is one system that uses Jabber for its instant messaging function. Although the Google Talk software is Windows-only, Macintosh and Linux users can tap into the system with other instant-messaging programs like iChat for Mac OS X or Psi for Linux. (Details for doing so are at www.google.com/talk/otherclients.html.)The Jabber Software Foundation has links to other Jabber programs and networks for instant messaging, along with information on how to get started, at www.jabber.org.The Security of Mac OSQ. Why are Macintosh computers thought to be safer from worms and viruses?A. The sheer dominance of Windows  along with its history of security issues  has traditionally made it a tempting target for those who write viruses, worms and other malicious programs. Over the years, Macintosh owners have enjoyed a relatively safer operating system, thanks to stricter default security settings and a much smaller user population, which may not be large enough to attract the interest of worm writers.But this is not to say that the Mac OS X operating system is completely secure and will remain so. Although they were not widespread, two worms designed to infiltrate Mac OS X appeared last February, as did a serious vulnerability with the way the Safari Web browser handles files. These were minor incidents, but they did prove that Mac OS X was not impervious to attack. With
Intel processors and increased visibility in the computing realm, some security experts have expressed concern that more malicious code may be aimed at Macs. As holes in the system are discovered, Apple Computer issues patches for Mac OS X  a security update released this spring, for example, fixed 31 vulnerabilities on Mac OS X, Safari and other parts of the system. (An overview of security features in Mac OS X is at www.apple.com/macosx/features/security.) Sites like SecureMac (www.securemac.com) and MacInTouch (www.macintouch.com) keep tabs on the topic, too.For now, though, Windows still draws most of the virus and worm attention. Microsoft releases frequent security updates for Windows, and
moved a few years ago to improve overall security with Windows XP Service Pack 2  which automatically turns on the system's firewall and shores up other defenses. The company outlines its own approach to security at www.microsoft.com/security. The coming Windows Vista system is made to be more resistant to attack than previous versions of Windows.Questions about computer-based technology may be sent to QandA @nytimes.com.
