Apple Showdown Heightens Challenge of Encrypted Data
Timothy Cook, the chief of Apple, warned of a chilling breach of privacy posed by a demand to unlock the iPhone that belonged to an attacker in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings.
The clash between the Justice Department and Apple over the court order requiring the company to weaken the security functions on the iPhone of one of the attackers in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings is only the latest instance of the governments effort to deal with encrypted data.The real challenge is how the courts will apply constitutional protections drafted in the 18th century to deal with the rapidly changing world of digital technology.The Fourth Amendment grants a measure of privacy for persons, houses, papers, and effects from unreasonable searches and seizures while requiring that warrants be issued based only on probable cause. But those protections do not go far in preventing the government from gaining access to a persons digital information in an investigation because probable cause is a low standard for getting a warrant.Moreover, Apples resistance to the order, issued under a 1789 law called the All Writs Act, is not based on the Constitution, because there is no question that the government has a sound basis to search for evidence that might be on the iPhone about planning for the attack in December.A letter issued last week by Timothy D. Cook, Apples chief executive, announcing the decision not to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation gain access to the data makes no mention of the Constitution. Instead, it talks more generally about the need to protect personal privacy and the security of customer information. As The New York Times pointed out, there may be a significant global business advantage to Apples stance that has little to do with what the law provides.
A much greater stumbling block for the government in obtaining encrypted data is the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which can be used to thwart efforts to get passwords required to unlock encrypted files. In the world of cryptology, a secret code known only to the user usually means that the information could be kept away from the government unless there is a means to compel the person to reveal it.The Fifth Amendment provides that an individual cannot be forced to be a witness against himself, which generally means the government cannot force someone to disclose information that can be used to convict that person. But whether it lets a person shield electronic files is a more complicated issue. Continue reading the main story
The scope of the privilege against self-incrimination came up last year in an insider trading case, and it illustrates how the courts have struggled to adapt the Fifth Amendment to gaining access to digital information.In Securities and Exchange Commission v. Huang, two defendants were accused of gathering confidential information from their employer, Capital One, about credit card usage at retailers to help identify which companies to buy shares. The bank provided smartphones to its employees, and each had a personal passcode known only to the user. The S.E.C. suspected that the defendants phones, which they returned to Capital One after resigning, contained information that would be helpful to proving the case, so it asked for a court order directing them to reveal their codes so the files could be opened.The defendants asserted the Fifth Amendment, claiming that revealing the codes could lead to potentially incriminating evidence useful in a criminal case because insider trading violations can be prosecuted by the Justice Department.The problem is figuring out how far the privilege against self-incrimination goes in protecting passwords that can open encrypted files.Individuals cannot be forced to reveal the contents of their own mind, but they can be required to turn over records that could reflect their thoughts. The Supreme Court held in Fisher v. United States that the content of documents  even if they are incriminating  is not protected by the Fifth Amendment.But the court then noted that the act of turning over the records, called the act of production, could convey information about their existence, possession and authenticity, and therefore that could be the basis for asserting the privilege against self-incrimination.
As if thats not confusing enough, the Supreme Court in the Fisher case then explained that the government could still force an individual to turn over documents if any information conveyed by the act of production was a foregone conclusion, meaning the government learned little new from turning them over.The nub of the issue is this: Does turning over a password to open up encrypted files reveal new information from the persons mind, or is it just like handing over a folder with documents the government already knows exists and is at your house?Courts love to use metaphors (or perhaps similes) to illustrate their analysis, even though these rarely have much explanatory power. Here is one Justice John Paul Stevens used in a dissenting opinion in Doe v. United States to explain how the Fifth Amendment operates for producing information: He may in some cases be forced to surrender a key to a strongbox containing incriminating documents, but I do not believe he can be compelled to reveal the combination to his wall safe.This is where the challenge of digital information makes the Fifth Amendment analysis more difficult. A password is a bit like a key, because it simply opens up files contained in the electronic version of a file cabinet. But it is also similar to the combination to a safe, such as the use of numbers in a specific sequence in the code.Figuring out which one it is has divided the courts. In the Huang case, the district judge denied the request to reveal the passwords, finding that as the S.E.C is not seeking business records but defendants personal thought processes, defendants may properly invoke their Fifth Amendment right.It turned out that denying access to the smartphones did not affect the case, as one defendant settled and a jury found the other engaged in insider trading.In an earlier case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Atlanta reached a similar conclusion when the Justice Department issued a grand jury subpoena requiring the production of unencrypted hard drives from a computer suspected of containing child pornography. The appeals court found that the act of decryption would be testimonial, and therefore subject to the Fifth Amendment.Other courts have reached the exact opposite conclusion regarding the availability of the Fifth Amendment to maintain the encryption of electronic records. The Federal District Court in Denver, in United States v. Fricosu, found that the privilege against self-incrimination did not prevent ordering an individual to decrypt the hard drive on a laptop computer. The case is similar to the one involving Apple because the court issued the order under the All Writs Act to compel assistance in furthering an investigation of possible wrongdoing.
In Commonwealth v. Gelfgatt, the Supreme Judicial Court in Massachusetts, the states highest court, found that compelling a lawyer to decrypt files related to a mortgage fraud scheme did not fall within the privilege against self-incrimination. The court noted that the defendant had admitted to installing the encryption program on his computers, so under the foregone conclusion analysis, it would not violate his rights to make him enter the password to decrypt them.Obtaining access to electronic files, especially emails and messages, can be crucial in white-collar crime cases. Proving a violation usually revolves around establishing a defendants knowledge and intent, so there is often no better proof than contemporaneous communications and documents created around the time of the transaction. If encryption keeps that kind of information away from investigators, it will make proving violations that much more difficult.Unlike an individual, companies cannot use the Fifth Amendment to encrypt their files to keep them away from the government because that constitutional protection does not apply to organizations. With the Justice Departments recent emphasis on identifying individuals involved in corporate misconduct as the primary measure of cooperation, getting to the personal data of employees can be crucial to proving a case, especially if companies encourage them to encrypt files as a security measure.It may be up to the Supreme Court to decide whether the privilege against self-incrimination protects individuals from having to turn over passwords to help the government obtain evidence that may well end up convicting them.The digital age is making it much more difficult to figure out how far the Constitution should go in dealing with forms of information that were largely unknown a generation ago, much less when the Fifth Amendment was adopted.
