prosecutors and the F.B.I. say that he sent code files to his personal e-mail account from a Goldman e-mail account, storing versions of the code files on home computers, a laptop and other storage devices.They said that, on July 2, he took the laptop and another storage device to a meeting in Chicago with his new employer, Teza Technologies, a high-frequency trading start-up.
