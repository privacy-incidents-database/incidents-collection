Department of Homeland Security Release on the Virus Warning
On Tuesday, Microsoft issued its monthly list of security flaws, including one that the company rated critical. It said an attacker who exploited the vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. That would make it possible to install malicious programs or to change or delete data.Yesterday the Department of Homeland Security said in a news release that it was urging anyone who used Windows software to install the patch as soon as possible. The department said its Computer Emergency Readiness Team was working with Microsoft to minimize the impact of the vulnerability.The department considered it prudent to advise the public using Microsoft operating systems to take this action, said Russ Knocke, a department spokesman. Its a proactive and prudent measure the department has chosen to take.Computer security experts said the flaw was similar to one exploited in 2003 by the MSBlast worm, which struck corporate computer systems, brought network traffic to a halt and compromised company data. It was among the most damaging computer viruses to date.Several computer security software firms said yesterday that they had already begun to see software tool kits that exploited the vulnerability, and Microsoft officials noted that they had seen some limited attacks.
