A few days ago, two well-spoken executives from the computer security concern Symantec came by the office to complain about Microsoft. Lots of software companies have complaints about Microsoft, of course, but its not every day that one of them embarks on a multicity media tour to voice them. That got my attention.
Joseph Nocera's PodcastTimesSelect subscribers can now listen to additional thoughts from Joseph Nocera on his column.
They wanted to talk about Microsofts new operating system, Vista, which the company plans to begin shipping soon to computer manufacturers, and will introduce it over the next several months. It is the first big upgrade of Windows in five years, and its a pretty big deal. Vista is important for the acceleration of growth for Microsoft, said Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs, the pre-eminent Wall Street analyst covering the company. Its also important that they solidify the security of the operating system.
Important? How about critical. How many times in the last few years have we read about worms or viruses or rootkits penetrating the operating system and wreaking havoc? The only real threat to the Microsoft franchise is security, said Dan Geer, the chief scientist at Verdasys, a computer security company. Vista is supposed to be the proof of Microsofts newly found commitment to safe, secure computing.
Yet the two Symantec executives were complaining that a new Microsoft security feature would cripple innovation in the computer security industry  while making it harder for companies like theirs to detect problems in the operating system. Another feature, they said, would confuse customers unnecessarily. They had other complaints as well.
I think their intent is to provide a more secure operating system, said Sarah Hicks, a vice president in Symantecs consumer products unit. But the impact of what they have done is that there will be less customer choice, less access to the operating system for companies like ours, and the stifling of innovation. Cris Paden, a public relations hand at Symantec, talked darkly about Microsofts desire to use its operating system to tilt the playing field to its advantage.
When you hear talk like that, of course, you immediately think of Netscape or Real Networks, two companies whose products suffered once Microsoft put its version of first a browser and then a music player into Windows. The former example led to the Microsoft antitrust trial; the latter led the European Union to impose hefty fines on Microsoft while forcing it to come out with a version of Windows with the Media Player stripped out. (Microsoft is appealing the fines.) Both examples helped brand Microsoft as a company that ruthlessly used its operating system monopoly to crush rivals.
Symantec, of course, knows quite well that that is the image such allegations conjure up  thats why it made the media tour. And maybe that is what is happening here. But it sure doesnt look that way to me.
One of the supreme ironies of the computer age is that Windows, in addition to giving rise to thousands of software companies that have taken advantage of its many features, has also given rise to a $12 billion industry that takes advantage of  indeed depends on  its many flaws. If Windows remains vulnerable, they sell more software, said Adrien Robinson, a Microsoft executive who is part of the companys security team.
Obviously, if Microsoft somehow managed to make Vista completely immune from attack, there would be no need for companies like Symantec. But that is never going to happen, for two reasons. First, no matter how hard Microsoft tries, Vista will never be fully secure. Hackers have become extremely sophisticated, and as soon as companies figure out how to stop, or at least reduce, one problem, some new, unforeseen threat emerges.
Second, that means Microsoft needs all the help it can get from the Symantecs and McAfees of the world. Its simply not in Microsofts best interest to Netscape those companies. Not that it could if it wanted to; not in the wake of the antitrust trial  and especially the continued scrutiny by the European Commission, which has become very sympathetic to the complaints of Microsoft competitors.
