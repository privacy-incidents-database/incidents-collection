Whenever I write about the Macintosh, I try to balance the machine's faults against its strengths, watching carefully for my own prejudices. Invariably, on such occasions, I receive letters from Macintosh radicals accusing me of being a true-blue I.B.M.'er who simply does not understand the marvel that Apple has created. I receive an equal number of missives from I.B.M. fanatics, who are convinced that I am an Apple spokesman who has been taken in by the Macintosh's fancy graphics and now is simply incapable of understanding how far superior to the Mac I.B.M.'s computers are.",
