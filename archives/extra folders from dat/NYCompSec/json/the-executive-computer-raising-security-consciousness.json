Having ventured into this territory before, we had come bearing fishing lines ending in treble hooks and lead weights. With a little skill, it was posssible to lower one's line and snag a loaf of raisin bread as it passed below. This particular day, however, the guard was onto us and our levitating bread trick. As we were looking down, he was coming up, a rock-salt-loaded shotgun in hand.",
