For Data Security, Sometimes Small Is Not Beautiful
It's wonderful, isn't it, that information can be packed into such an infinitesimal space that vital facts about millions of people can fit on a few little computer disks. Farewell, bulky file cabinets; hello, vast empty spaces that can be used, say, for meditating on the joys of miniaturization.
But any such meditation was rudely interrupted last week by yet another reminder that there is a hazardous flip side to all this. And the latest breach was a big one: Social Security numbers and other personal information on up to 26.5 million veterans were stolen from the home of a Department of Veterans Affairs employee. All the more reason, then, to take note of a survey for the Cyber Security Industry Alliance that shows, among other things, that nearly half of likely voters may turn against any member of Congress who opposes swift action on data security. And that survey, of course, was taken before the loss of the veterans' data.Suddenly those nice, bulky, hard-to-transport file cabinets don't look so bad.HUBERT B. HERRING
