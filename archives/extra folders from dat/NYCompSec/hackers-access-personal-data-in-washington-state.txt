U.S.|Hackers Retrieve Personal Data in Washington State
OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP)  The Washington State Administrative Office of the Courts was hacked sometime between last fall and February, and up to 160,000 Social Security numbers and a million drivers license numbers could have been obtained during the data breach of its public Web site, officials said Thursday.Court officials said they have confirmed only that 94 Social Security numbers were obtained and they do not believe the larger number was compromised, but they wanted to alert the public to the possibility as a precaution. The 94 people affected are being contacted.The broader information just happened to be on a server in an area that was accessed, said Veronica Diseth, director of the courts information services division.The breach happened because of a vulnerability in an Adobe Systems software program, ColdFusion, that has since been patched, court officials said. An Adobe spokeswoman, Heather Edell, confirmed that the problem had been resolved.Mike Keeling, the courts information technology operations and maintenance manager, said officials were alerted to the breach by an East Coast business that had a similar intrusion.Court officials first believed all of the information obtained was public record, and did not think confidential information was taken, but after an inquiry by the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the broader breach was confirmed in April, a courts spokeswoman said.
