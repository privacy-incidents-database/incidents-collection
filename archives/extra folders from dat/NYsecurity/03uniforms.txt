BAGHDAD, Iraq, Aug. 2  The camouflaged Iraqi commandos who kidnapped 20 people from a pair of central Baghdad offices this week used Interior Ministry vehicles and left little trace of their true identities.
A Baghdad tailor worked on military and police uniforms. The government plans to introduce new uniforms that will be difficult to copy.
Were they legitimate officers? Members of a Shiite or Sunni death squad? Or
criminals in counterfeit uniforms bought at the market? Majid
Hamid, 41, a Sunni human rights worker whose brother was kidnapped and killed by men in uniform four months ago, said he doubted that the answer would ever be known. Now, he said, the
be responsible for the crime. Whenever I see uniforms now, I figure they must be militias, Mr. Hamid said in a recent interview. I immediately try to avoid them. If I have my gun, I know I need to be ready to use it.Such is the attitude of Iraqis in this capital shellshocked and made fearful
by violence that seems to be committed almost daily by men dressed as those who are supposed to protect and serve. The audacious
kidnapping on Monday was just the latest case of men using the signals of law and safety  a uniform, a vehicle with blue lights, a patch on the sleeve  to attack and abduct.
Everywhere Iraqis in uniform go, from ice cream shops to checkpoints, people now flee. The mottled mix of green, blue and khaki camouflage, along with the blue
shirts of the local police, have all blurred into a flag for alarm. En eles, Iraqis in Baghdad now say when a friend has been taken; in traditional Arabic
it means chewed up, but in the streets it has come to mean
taken by mysterious men without explanation. American and Iraqi officials have been promising for weeks to address the problem. This week, the interior minister, Jawad Bolani, acknowledged that rogues were among his ranks. He told Parliament that new uniforms and identification cards would soon be supplied to hobble those who carry out bad activities under the cover of this institution.The first 2,000 of 25,000 new uniforms are scheduled to be handed out later this month, officials said. Made with imported camouflage cloth and intricate patches and insignias, they are designed to be difficult to copy. Their source, as well as other details about them, is being kept secret in part to reduce the risk of counterfeiting. But only a small percentage of the 145,000 Interior Ministry officers  from the national police, public order brigades and other forces  will get them. Even if they all had new uniforms, trust would be hard to resuscitate
in Baghdad, where dozens of people are killed or found dead every day. With more forces being added to the streets as part of a security plan begun two months ago, the permutations of officialdom have spiraled.On a recent afternoon at the Interior Ministrys headquarters in Baghdad, three white pickup trucks with generic police lights drove by carrying men in a half-dozen versions of official dress. A handful of Toyota sport utility vehicles carrying men in various uniforms also passed. I bet even the Interior Ministry cant tell who is in the trucks and who belongs to which brigade, said Mr. Hamid, who has been working with the American military to find his brothers killers. Under Saddam Hussein, it was simpler. Into the early 1990s, both the national police and the Iraqi Army wore olive fatigues; a silver star on the cap and shoulder denoted the police; a golden eagle meant the army. According to several Baghdad tailors, two markets in the capital had licenses to sell the uniforms and no one dared copy them. Later, though, privately made uniforms began to appear when sanctions kept the government from providing all forces with the official ones. The American invasion in 2003 and the rush to fill Iraqi security forces opened the door to a flood of private production, some of it legitimate, some of it not. Ali Muhammad, 22, a tailor in the poor Shiite district of Sadr City, said that six months after the invasion, requests for camouflage uniforms began pouring in. At first, he refused. But the money was good  nearly twice what he could earn sewing suits  and with sectarian violence scaring away other customers, he said he needed it. 12Next Page »Edward Wong, Sahar Najeeb and Hosham Hussein contributed reporting for this article.
