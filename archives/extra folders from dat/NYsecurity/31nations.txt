U.N. Deplores Civilian Deaths, but Cease-Fire Call Is Blocked
UNITED NATIONS, July 30  The Security Council issued a statement Sunday evening expressing “extreme shock and distress” at the killing of Lebanese civilians in the bombing of Qana after daylong negotiations in which the United States succeeded in blocking a call from Secretary General Kofi Annan for an immediate cessation of hostilities.
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan condemned Israel's attack in the Lebanese town of Qana during an emergency meeting of the Security Council today.
Text of Security Council's Statement on Qana Attack
The Council, in the final version of the nonbinding declaration, deplored the loss of innocent lives, called for “an end to violence” and cited the “urgency of securing a lasting, permanent and sustainable cease-fire.” John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, said that what the United States had objected to was “conclusionary language about the nature of the incident and language that attempted to foreshadow the political solution,” which he said was being pursued by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. He continued: “This is a very delicate matter that requires careful discussion so that rather than jump to conclusions about cease-fires and other matters, we thought it was important to let that play out and do what was important to do, which was to address the tragic loss of civilian life.” The statement urged all parties to grant immediate and unlimited access to civilian aid and asked Mr. Annan to report back to the Security Council within a week on the circumstances of the Qana bombing. The statement fell short of the request earlier in the day from Mr. Annan, who asked the Council to “condemn in the strongest possible terms” the killings and reiterated his call for an immediate halt in the fighting between Israel and the Hezbollah militia. In the emergency Sunday meeting of the Security Council requested by Lebanon, Mr. Annan said, “We meet at a moment of extreme gravity, first and foremost for the people of the Middle East, but also for the authority of this organization, especially this Council.” Mr. Annan said,
“But,” he added, “by its manner of doing so, it has caused and is causing death and suffering on a wholly unacceptable scale.” The United States has refused to back Mr. Annan’s call for a cessation of hostilities, saying that any halt must be one that removes the threat to Israel from Hezbollah. The members were also beginning discussions that were likely to continue this week of the text of a draft resolution by France circulated late Saturday. The Sunday statement affirmed the Council’s determination to work without delay to adopt a resolution “drawing on diplomatic efforts under way.” The French-drafted measure calls for an immediate halt to fighting, the release of two Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah on July 12, the disarming of all militias in Lebanon and the creation of a buffer zone in southern Lebanon free of any military personnel except the Lebanese Army and United Nations-mandated international forces. Mr. Annan challenged the 15-member panel to take swift action, saying, “The authority and standing of this Council are at stake.” But Dan Gillerman, the Israeli ambassador, said
Hezbollah had used Lebanese civilians as human shields and had deliberately exposed them to danger in the hopes of stirring expressions of outrage against Israel. “What is happening around this table is exactly what they wanted to happen,” he said.
Lebanese civilians “may have been killed by Israeli fire,” Mr. Gillerman said, “but they are the victims of Hezbollah, victims of terror.” The Council has been unable to take a stand on the fighting because of objections by the United States to actions that would be critical of Israel. Last week, in a reaction that openly frustrated some Council members, it was able to produce only a statement expressing shock and distress at the Israeli bombing of a United Nations outpost in which four unarmed observers were killed. “People have noticed its failure to act firmly and quickly during this crisis,” Mr. Annan said. This frustration, he argued, played a role in demonstrations against the United Nations headquarters in Beirut on Sunday in which protesters broke into the building. Nouhad Mahmoud, a Lebanese Foreign Ministry official, told Security Council members: “We are committed to the United Nations. We believe it to be a haven for the weak and victims of injustice more than a podium for the strong. Will we find in you the answer to what the Lebanese people seek?”
