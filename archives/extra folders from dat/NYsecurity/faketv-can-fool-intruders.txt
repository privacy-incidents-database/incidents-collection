You might not be home every evening watching television, but no burglar needs to know that. The coruscating light of a television set — signature feature of an occupied home — might be enough to scare prowlers off.
That’s the idea behind FakeTV ($35), a security gadget that replicates a television’s flickering light in all of its dynamic variety, from kinetic commercials to subdued news reports.The lightweight wedge, smaller than a slice of cake, is the brainchild of Blaine Readler, an engineer, who intentionally left his TV on when going out one night. The fake version, which uses bright LEDs, saves wear and tear on a real TV, as well as the cost of electricity. Energy-wise, it’s equivalent to a 2-watt night light, said Rein Teder, president of the manufacturer, Hydreon Corporation.And unlike most TVs today, which turn on and off with buttons or remotes, FakeTV can be put on a timer.
