Confusion and Delays at Airports, Taken Mostly in Stride
A passenger took a nap on Thursday on the floor at Kennedy Airport as Michael Chertoff, the director of Homeland Security, gave a televised briefing on the situation.
Thousands of travelers caught in webs of tightened security faced long lines, canceled flights, frustrating delays and screening changes at airports across the New York region and the country yesterday, but most responded with the grudging acceptance of citizen-soldiers in the war on terror.

Andrea Gomez, 30, of Miami, returning from London, went through customs at Kennedy Thursday holding a clear bag with her passport and other items, as British officials had required.
New precautions prompted by what officials called a thwarted terrorist plot in Britain to blow up flights to the United States slowed air travel in some regions, created chaos at a few airports and wore down security staff and passengers, who had to throw out liquids and gels, endure hours of waiting and settle for later flights.In the New York region, the confusion and delays were worse in the morning, when travelers who had not yet learned of the terrorist plot and the overnight security changes arrived at airports expecting to whisk through lines, only to find grim faces and new rules at screening checkpoints.Babies screamed, frazzled mothers lugged infants, and travelers slumped on luggage and stepped in and out of lines seeking information, repacking bags to meet the new rules and mumbling into cellphones in a cacophony watched over by enlarged security forces with machine guns and dogs.But by afternoon, the lines and delays grew shorter as screeners and travelers got accustomed to the changes, which had been ordered by Homeland Security officials. The orders banned liquids or gels from carry-on baggage, including all beverages, shampoos, suntan lotions, creams, toothpastes, hair gels and similar items. Exceptions were made for baby formulas and medicines, provided that prescriptions matched the name on a passengers ticket.Gov. George E. Pataki sent National Guard troops to Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports to beef up Port Authority patrols. Richard J. Codey, the acting governor of New Jersey while Jon S. Corzine was on vacation, did not order troops to Newark Liberty International Airport.It was unclear how long the stepped-up security forces and tighter procedures would be kept in place. But based on the first days experience, officials said smoother operations, shorter lines and fewer delays and cancellations might be expected in the days to come. Travelers were urged to bring no carry-on bags, to pack liquids and gels in checked luggage and to arrive two hours early at airports. At Newark Airport yesterday, the wait exceeded two hours at one point in the morning. At Terminal B, which handles many international flights, one line stretched 200 yards. The procedural changes have resulted in the longest lines of the summer, said Mark Hatfield Jr., the acting federal security director for Newark Airport.By late afternoon, a total of 23 arriving and 23 departing flights had been
canceled at Newark Airport, although only one was an international flight, said Pasquale DiFulco, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. He said only two flights from Kennedy Airport to Britain were canceled, one by American Airlines and the other by British Airways. At La Guardia, he said, there were no cancellations.As the day wore on, the crush eased. Port Authority officials said that by noon, flights at La Guardia were being delayed an average of 15 minutes, while officials at Kennedy
said that incoming and outgoing flights were mostly on schedule, with only scattered minor delays.Many of the travelers were on vacation, looking forward to exotic destinations; others were off on business, concerned about deals and deadlines; and among the passengers at Kennedy Airport was a contingent of American soldiers, in uniform, bound on a commercial flight for 18 months of duty in Iraq. While many travelers voiced exasperation at screening changes that had been thrust upon them with little notice, most accepted them with a minimum of grumbling, and some even embraced them.Thank God we have people who are alert and they are monitoring these evil, bad, barbaric savages whose one agenda is to destroy, said Esther Jungreis, a Holocaust survivor awaiting an El Al flight to Israel from Newark Airport. My mindset is such that I appreciate the inconvenience for safety.Security personnel at airports handed out fliers with the new regulations. For some, they were just an inconvenience.
Can you carry on deodorant? Rich Ergo, 50, of Walnut Creek, Calif., asked at a checkpoint at Kennedy as he and his daughter, Melissa, 16, lined up for a flight home. He was told he could.12Next Page »Reporting for this article was contributed by Michael Amon, Tina Kelley, Corey Kilgannon and Colin Moynihan.
