Few Foreign Visitors to U.S. Overstay Visa, Federal Report Says
A little more than 1 percent of the nearly 45 million foreign visitors to the United States overstayed their work or tourist visas last year, according to a long-awaited report by the Department of Homeland Security.The report, released late Tuesday, comes as Congress is examining the visa system in the United States after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last month that left 14 people dead and 22 wounded. Tashfeen Malik, one of the attackers, was granted entry to the United States under a K-1 visa, also known as a fiancé visa. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was an American-born citizen. Both died in a shootout with the police.The attack is believed to have been inspired by the Islamic State terrorist group. Lawmakers fear that terrorists could exploit weaknesses in the visa program, including the program’s inability to accurately track people who overstay, to carry out attacks on American soil.The report, which lawmakers have been demanding for nearly 20 years, shows that the number of overstays — about a half-million in all — was slightly higher for citizens of countries where a visa is required to visit the United States than for those from countries like France and Germany who are exempt under a visa-waiver program. About 38 countries, mostly in Europe, participate in the visa-waiver program, which allows their citizens to visit the United States without a visa on trips of 90 days or less.Officials acknowledge that the report is imprecise. It covers visitors who arrived in the United States by plane or ship, but not those who entered by land.
The report, mandated by Congress in 1997, is the first to conclusively examine a population that immigration officials know little about. Lawmakers have pressed Homeland Security officials for information on those who overstay their visas, but efforts to collect the information have dragged because of the difficulty in collecting and analyzing data.In early 2013, Janet Napolitano, then the secretary of Homeland Security, told Congress that the agency planned to issue a report on overstay rates by December 2013. The agency did not follow through because officials said they did not have confidence in the quality of the data.Now that the first report on overstays has been completed, it will be done annually, Homeland Security officials said.Many members of Congress and some law enforcement officials worry about misuse of the visa program because the United States does not routinely collect biometric information — fingerprints, iris scans and photographs that can be used for facial recognition — of people leaving the country. Nearly three dozen countries collect such information.Two of the Sept. 11 hijackers, Satam al-Suqami and Nawaf al-Hazmi, overstayed their visas.Experts like Theresa Cardinal Brown, the director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, who served in the Homeland Security Department under President George W. Bush, said that although the United States had traditionally collected lots of information about people arriving in the country, it had focused less on those who leave. And because information about exits is not collected in a systematic way, it is difficult for customs officials to compare it to entry data to see if a visitor left the country before their visa expired.Nearly 20 years ago, Congress passed a law requiring the federal government to develop a system to track people who overstayed their visas. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, an entry and exit tracking system was seen as a vital national security and counterterrorism tool, and the 9/11 Commission recommended that the Department of Homeland Security complete a system “as soon as possible.”Since then, the federal government has spent millions of dollars on the effort, yet until the release of the report Tuesday, officials could only roughly estimate the number of people in the United States illegally after overstaying visas.Officials with Homeland Security told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee during a hearing on Wednesday that the department was testing new technologies that would allow United States Customs and Border Protection to collect exit information from foreign travelers. The technologies include a facial recognition program that began at Kennedy International Airport on Tuesday.
