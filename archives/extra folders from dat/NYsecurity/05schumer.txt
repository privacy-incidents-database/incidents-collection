Domestic Security Since 9/11 Is Barely Better, Schumer Says
Senator Charles E. Schumer talks about a new comprehensive homeland security report card revealing security holes in front of ground zero.
Domestic security remains mediocre at best, and in some ways has barely improved, since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Senator Charles E. Schumer said yesterday.
Over all, Mr. Schumer gave efforts to make the nation safer from attack a grade of C-, about the same as the marks he assigned in similar exercises in 2002, 2003 and 2004. Of the 12 areas he examined in a report, he said a few remained particularly bad: security for mass transit, shipping ports and chemical plants; the use of devices that can detect explosives and other weapons; and grants to law enforcement authorities and firefighters.A promise was made to the American people that after 9/11, every step would be taken, Mr. Schumer said, standing near the rim of the enormous pit at the World Trade Center site. Unfortunately, too much of that promise remains unfulfilled.Russ Knocke, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said, We have, ultimately, finite resources that are used to focus on the most serious threats. For instance, he said, if we were to inspect every container that comes into our country, ports would shut down.He called the senators report half-baked, saying that it seems to rely upon the premise that government can prevent all threats for all people for all time.Mr. Schumer said that raising the defense against terrorism to acceptable levels would probably mean doubling the departments budget, now about $32 billion a year. The federal government has spent $300 billion on the war in Iraq, he said, so $30 billion on homeland security doesnt seem like a lot to ask.As the fifth anniversary of the attacks approached, Senator Schumer asserted that the Bush administration and Congressional leaders have still not shown the will to spend enough, and that the Department of Homeland Security has been poorly run and has reneged on commitments, partly as a result of lack of money.Most of the material in Mr. Schumers 14-page report is not new; it was culled from sources like the 9/11 Commission, the Rand Corporation, the Council on Foreign Relations and various government agencies. But of the dozens of specifics it cites, many  like the lack of tamperproof seals on shipping containers, or background checks of truck drivers - admitted to the ports  have received little attention.Mr. Schumer gave his highest grades to nuclear plant security, B+, and aviation security, B-. He said airline safety had improved significantly, citing changes like secure cockpit doors, more
marshals on flights and upgraded passenger and baggage screening.But he separated that category from efforts to develop and deploy machinery that can find weapons by peering into baggage or detect minute traces of dangerous chemicals or germs  for which he said the government had earned an F.He gave another failing grade to mass transit security  a particular concern to metropolitan New York  saying that the government spends $9 per passenger on airline security but only 1 cent per mass transit rider.
