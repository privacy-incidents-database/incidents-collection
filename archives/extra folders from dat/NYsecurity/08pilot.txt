WASHINGTON — Security rules imposed after the Christmas Day bombing attempt may diminish another one of the gee-whiz aspects of flying, the moments when the captain plays tour guide, pointing out landmarks to the passengers.Immediately after the attempt to bomb the Northwest flight from Amsterdam to Detroit, the Transportation Security Administration issued a directive to the airlines banning such announcements in the last hour of flight. The agency also ordered the airlines to turn off the maps on the in-flight entertainment system that show the plane’s progress to its destination.The agency relented slightly on both issues a few days later, at the same time that it also removed an absolute ban on passengers standing up or using the lavatories in the last hour of in-bound international flights. It left decisions on all those activities to the captain.But an official at one American carrier that operates across the oceans said that if the T.S.A. advises it, the crews “usually do what is suggested.”A pilot on another international carrier said that he and some of his colleagues thought
the caution against pointing out landmarks made very little sense. “The passengers can look out the windows,” he said.Both men spoke on condition of anonymity, because, they said, they were not supposed to talk about security directives.
