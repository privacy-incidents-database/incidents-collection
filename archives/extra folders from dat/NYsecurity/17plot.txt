Europe Says It Will Unify Effort in Fight on Terrorism
Finlands interior minister, Kari Rajamaki, left; John Reid, Britains home secretary; and Franco Frattini, the vice president of the European Commission, discussed plans to cooperate on antiterrorism initiatives.
LONDON, Aug. 16  European ministers in charge of security
pledged Wednesday to increase their cooperation to fight terrorism, saying they may begin by blocking certain Internet sites, using fingerprinting or iris-scanning technology, and training Muslim preachers to discourage militancy.
Readers' OpinionsReaders shared their thoughts on the terror arrests and the vulnerability of the United States.
Ministers from Finland, Germany, Portugal, Slovenia and France met here with the British home secretary, John Reid, to map out new anti-terrorism measures. Afterward, in a news conference, they laid out proposals that signaled a shift for Europe, which has been loath to limit individual freedoms or to try to impose a uniform set of values.We face a persistent and very real threat across Europe, said Mr. Reid. Would-be terrorists are hoping to abuse our open societies, he said, and have no regard for human life and human rights. Ultimately, the rights of the individual must and will be balanced against the collective rights of security and protection of life and limb, he said.The ministers said they would speed up plans to increase cooperation between the intelligence forces in their home countries, and allow them to share information directly with their counterparts. They also plan to step up cooperation on research into explosives, particularly liquid explosives. European Union nations may establish rapid response antiterrorism teams that could rush to the aid of member states, the ministers said.While sharing information may be desirable, some governments have resisted it because of varying law enforcement and counterterrorism practices, said Martin R. Pollner, senior partner at the law firm Loeb & Loeb in New York and a former United States representative to Interpol, the international police network.British law enforcement officials, for instance, typically wait longer to arrest terrorism suspects than do American authorities, he said, because the British want to let a plot develop further so they have stronger evidence when it comes to prosecuting a case. That may have made them reluctant in the past to share information with European or other colleagues, Mr. Pollner said.So far, in response to the British announcement that it had uncovered a
plot to blow up as many as 10 trans-Atlantic airliners, possibly using liquid explosives, European countries have imposed a patchwork of makeshift rules with varying levels of security restrictions. The haphazard response has raised concerns in Britain that terrorists could simply board a plane elsewhere and cause the same damage they would have if they had managed to breach security in Britain.Mr. Reid said at the news conference that European governments should
coordinate their response to ensure that it is no easier to get through security in Paris or Frankfurt than it is in London.The European Union members are discussing the possibility of blocking Web sites that incite people to commit terrorist activities or provide details about how to make bombs, Franco Frattini, vice president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said at the news conference.
There are borders between freedom of expression and incitement of terrorism, he said of the possibility of blockades.Plans to shut down Web sites that incite terrorism have already been discussed in the Council of the European Union. How such a plan would be carried out raises a host of questions, though, including how to define terrorism.Passengers on flights to or from European nations may be subject to biometric screening, Mr. Frattini said, which could include fingerprint and iris scans.
The ministers did not discuss racial profiling, he said, and any new airline screens would have nothing to do with religious beliefs.In addition, ministers are proposing closer cooperation between governments and their Muslim populations. Mr. Frattini outlined a plan to organize meetings of Muslim teachers to eradicate violence from inside. Governments may also work to train imams to attempt to prevent the development of militancy.We do want a European Islam, Mr. Frattini said. That is very important, not only to show to the Muslim communities that we fully respect other religions, other faiths, but we also want them to respect national laws, European laws and fundamental rights, and first of all the right to life. At the moment, there are two fundamentally different sets of values in play in Europe, Mr. Reid said. One is the values of the European Union, including democracy, freedom and justice to all. The second is the values of totalitarianism, which hopes to subvert a religion whose very name stands for peace, he said, referring to Islam. Fears about continuing security lapses were heightened Wednesday by reports that a 12-year-old boy
managed on Monday to pass through security checks at Gatwick Airport outside London. He had slipped onto a Lisbon-bound plane without a boarding pass or a passport before the cabin crew spotted him. The boy had apparently run away from home in
Liverpool and traveled to London by train. The boy had passed through our full security screening process, so he had passed through the search process, a spokesman for the airport operator, BAA,
told BBC radio. Im confident there was no threat at any stage to passengers and staff or to the aircraft.British Airways had said that it would operate 90 percent of its scheduled flights on Wednesday. The airline said it would return to normal on Friday.Airport workers struggled to clear a backlog of thousands of undelivered checked bags at Heathrow and other airports. Theft of baggage has reportedly been a growing problem, as passengers were initially required to check everything except essentials like passports and wallets. That meant that valuable items like cameras and laptop computers were consigned to checked baggage.On Wednesday the police also obtained permission from the judicial system for extra time to detain and question suspects arrested in the alleged plot. The initial warrants to hold 23 of 24 suspects were to expire Wednesday, but under British antiterror laws, the authorities can detain suspects for up to 28 days without charge. A police statement said the warrants for 21 suspects were extended until Aug. 23 and for the two others until Monday.Scotland Yard later said a person arrested on Tuesday as part of its investigation had been released without charge, The Associated Press reported. Another detainee was released without charge on Friday.
