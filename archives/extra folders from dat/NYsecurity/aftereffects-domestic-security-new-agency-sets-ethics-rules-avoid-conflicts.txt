AFTEREFFECTS: DOMESTIC SECURITY; New Agency Sets Ethics Rules To Avoid Conflicts of Interest
The Department of Homeland Security said today that it was establishing ethics rules to ensure that lobbyists with personal connections to Secretary Tom Ridge and other senior officials would not receive special favors from the agency.
Department officials said that the rules have been under discussion for months, that they would be similar to conflict-of-interest rules at other federal agencies and that the details would be supplied to Congress when the rules were completed.
In testimony to Congress on Thursday, Mr. Ridge said he was aware that several of his former aides at the White House and on his staff when he was the governor of Pennsylvania had recently registered as domestic security lobbyists.
''I might say that I have known those people for a long time,'' he said, asked about an article in The New York Times that disclosed the lobbying activities of his former aides.
''But they've also known me for a long time, and if they learned one thing in our relationship, it's that the personal side won't do them any good unless they've got the best product for this country,'' he said.
At the hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Mr. Ridge said that ''one of the first responsibilities'' of the department's general counsel would be ''our own internal code to deal with potential conflicts.''
He added: ''I think it's very appropriate that the department have its own set of internal guidelines relating to ethics and conflicts, and we will.''
At least four of Mr. Ridge's senior aides at the Office of Homeland Security in the White House now work for firms seeking to capitalize on the booming niche of the Washington lobbying business that is focused on domestic security -- and on winning contracts from Mr. Ridge's new, multibillion-dollar agency.
Another former aide, Mark Campbell, Mr. Ridge's former chief of staff in the governor's office, has also registered as a domestic security lobbyist in Washington and travels here regularly from his home in Pennsylvania.
Brian Roehrkasse, a department spokesman, said the ethics rules for the new department were still under discussion. ''We do have an ethics program and we are beginning to move forward on other components of it,'' he said. ''A lot of this is not complete, which is not surprising for such a new agency.''
He said that the rules would aim for ''evenhanded'' treatment of companies seeking to sell the department their products or services.
Lobbying registration forms filed in Congress show that Mr. Ridge's former aides are lobbying on behalf of a variety of companies and industries that want domestic-security contracts from the government, including Tyco Electronics and SAP, the European software maker.
Mr. Roehrkasse said he believed the department would move quickly toward completing the new conflict-of-interest rules once the Senate confirms Joe E. Whitley, a former senior Justice Department official who has been nominated as the department's first general counsel.
Even as he questioned Mr. Ridge at the hearing about the lobbying activities of his former aides, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, repeatedly praised Mr. Ridge for having set ''a very high ethical standard'' at the new department. ''We have great confidence that that will be maintained through those guidelines,'' he said. ''We know you well enough to believe that deeply.''
