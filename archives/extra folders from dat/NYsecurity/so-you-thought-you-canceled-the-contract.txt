Your Money|So You Thought You Canceled the Contract
IT’S a shame that no one sells a home alarm system that can detect unscrupulous home alarm system salesmen. Now that is a product that a lot of people could use.Q. In September 2009, I had a home alarm system from Security Networks installed, and signed up for a 39-month contract, which ended in December 2012. Because of issues with installation and customer service, I decided that I would cancel the contract at the end of the term. In October last year, I sent a cancellation letter to the company, which is based in West Palm Beach, Fla.But in January, I noticed that the company had billed my credit card. I called Security Networks, and it told me that I had signed a five-year extension in May, and that my contract was not over until 2017.After I told the company about my cancellation letter, it e-mailed me a copy of a form that it said was a contract extension. And there was my signature, scrawled right on it. I was baffled until I recalled that a guy from Security Networks had shown up on my doorstep in May. He told me that he was doing a “system checkout” and that he would be back in a few minutes.He returned, and asked me to sign a form acknowledging the visit. The white piece of paper that he showed me was on a clipboard with papers folded back, obscuring the top of the page. I signed the form.
It turns out that the top and hidden part was a contract extension.I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, disputed the charge on my credit card and canceled my credit card to stop paying the company. But Security Networks says it expects me to pay or that it will ruin my credit rating.I was told that I could “buy out” the contract if I sent Security Networks almost $1,000, or that I could transfer the entire contract to a “friend, relative or neighbor.” No way. I would never foist this company onto anyone.I contacted a lawyer, who told me that he would need a $3,000 retainer to take the case. The entire five-year contract will cost $2,279.40, so the lawyer route doesn’t make financial sense.I am actually losing sleep over this. Can you help me?DONNA THURSTONVirginia Beach, Va.A. This is actually Security Networks’ second appearance in this highly uncoveted space.Four years ago, the Haggler wrote about a couple from North Carolina who were unable to cancel their contract with the company. Since then, a pretty steady flow of unhappy Security Networks customers have been writing with their own tales, most of them about how their contracts were auto-renewed despite efforts to ditch their alarm systems.Then there are the complaint Web sites, which offer plenty of variations on this theme. The Haggler’s favorite, in the most perverse sense of the word: the couple who wound up paying two alarm companies. That happened, their posting said, after a Security Networks salesman showed up and said the company had taken over the contracts of customers with a rival system. Well, it hadn’t. A Security Networks system was installed and the couple now pay $50 a month for two companies.You see? A home alarm for home-alarm company salesmen. Inventors of America, get busy.In Ms. Thurston’s case, the Haggler showed up a little late to pull his patent-pending, Haggler-to-the-rescue move. She had succeeded in wearing down Security Networks on her own, and if you’re wondering how, it was through a complaint filed with the Southeast Florida chapter of the Better Business Bureau. On the bureau’s Web page devoted to Security Networks, you will find that the company has had 560 complaints against it in the last three years.To its credit, Security Networks engages with those complainers, though the bureau says dozens of customers come away dissatisfied with this engagement.
Ms. Thurston, on the other hand, was let out of her contract, and the company even refunded a payment that she made in December. Suffice it to say, she is still peeved by the entire experience.“They will not stop what they are doing,” she wrote last week, “just because I got them to stop harassing me.”A rep at Security Networks named Joseph Shields looked into Ms. Thurston’s situation and wrote that the company “expects its staff to be ethical at all times.” Mr. Shields added that Security Networks “takes pride in providing the highest-quality service and under no circumstances would the company condone any form of customer deception.”He also apologized for what he called a “misunderstanding.”Misunderstanding does not seem the right word for what happened to Ms. Thurston. And given that Security Networks could learn who tricked her into signing up for nearly $2,300 worth of service, you would think that Mr. Shields might have typed a few lines about how the salesman in question, employed by an authorized affiliate, is now in a Soviet-style retraining camp, where borscht is served three times a day. The Haggler imagines classes there in civility, taught in a sweat lodge by a drill sergeant. Every few weeks, the salesman signs papers that he thinks will get him released — and each time, fine print hidden on the document requires him to stay put another month. Or he can just leave and his credit score will stink forever.
