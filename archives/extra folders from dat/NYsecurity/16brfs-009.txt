Explosives hidden in shoes show up clearly on X-rays at airport security checkpoints, the head of the Transportation Security Administration said as he displayed X-ray images. After the British broke up what they said was a plot to blow up planes flying to the United States last week, the agency began requiring all travelers to remove shoes X-rays at checkpoints.
The agency administrator, Kip Hawley, said the images he showed were released to counter reports of a classified report that indicated there might be difficulties in spotting explosives in shoes.
