Late last week a publicist called, peddling a new book meant to replace ''Security Analysis'' by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, the 1934 bible for value investors. ''Badly outmoded and out of date,'' the pitch went.
Now that corporate earnings and the upward momentum of stock prices are slowing, Graham and Dodd make perfect summer reading for investors looking to get their bearings. Indeed, the authors' description of market strategies prevailing in the pre-Crash 1920's -- the so-called New-Era Theory of investing -- is eerie:
The notion that the desirability of a common stock was entirely independent of its price seems incredibly absurd. Yet the new-era theory led directly to this thesis. If a public utility stock was selling at 35 times its maximum recorded earnings, instead of 10 times its average earnings, which was the pre-boom standard, the conclusion to be drawn was not that the stock was now too high but merely that the standard of value had been raised.
Instead of judging the market price by established standards of value, the new era based its standards of value upon the market price. Hence, all upper limits disappeared, not only upon the price at which a stock could sell, but even upon the price at which it would deserve to sell.
Fast-forward 60 years or so and try to imagine what Graham and Dodd would think of Ameritrade, the discount brokerage, selling for 1,304 times earnings; Intuit, the personal-finance software maker, fetching 342 times earnings, or America Online, going for 199 times earnings.
But most paradoxical was the early abandonment of research and analysis in guiding investment-trust policies. [Investment trusts were the 1920's version of mutual funds.] Investment had now become so beautifully simple that research was unnecessary and statistical data a mere encumbrance. The investment process consisted merely of finding prominent companies with a rising trend of earnings and then buying their shares regardless of price. Hence, the sound policy was to buy only what everyone else was buying -- a select list of highly popular and exceedingly expensive issues, appropriately known as the ''blue chips.''
Today's select group includes Coca-Cola, Dell Computer, Lucent Technologies, Cisco Systems, Intel, Excite, Compaq Computer, Amazon.com, Home Depot, General Electric, Yahoo, MCI Communications, Worldcom, America Online and Microsoft. The Nifty 15.
David Dreman, head of Dreman Value Management, finds the increasing divergence between the Nifty 15 and the rest of the market disturbingly similar to what preceded the nation's last bitter bear market, in 1973-74. ''But the multiples are higher this time around,'' he said. ''Back in the 1970's, we had stocks with great stories and great earnings. A lot of the stories now are concepts without major earnings as yet.''
Ominously, many of the Nifty 15 fell on Friday, even during a morning when the market averages were strong. It was the first time these stocks had weakened in the face of market strength.
There emerged a companion theory that common stocks represented the most profitable and therefore the most desirable media for long-term investment. This gospel was based upon a certain amount of research, showing that diversified lists of common stocks had regularly increased in value over stated intervals of time for many years past.
Finally there's this similarity between the 1920's mood on Wall Street and the day traders and Internet stock jockeys crowding in and out of stocks these days:
Making money in the stock market was now the easiest thing in the world. It was only necessary to buy ''good'' stocks, regardless of price, and then to let nature take her upward course.
Countless people asked themselves, ''Why work for a living when a fortune can be made in Wall Street without working?'' The ensuing migration from business into the financial district resembled the famous gold rush to the Klondike, with the not unimportant difference that there really was gold in the Klondike.
