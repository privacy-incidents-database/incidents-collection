BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 1  Three weeks after American and Iraqi troops began searching, fortifying and patrolling Dora, one of Baghdads bloodiest neighborhoods, the odor of death on the streets has eased. After 126 bodies surfaced in Dora in July, only 18 turned up in August, according to United States military figures. Killings, most often Sunni against Shiite or vice versa in this mixed neighborhood, dropped as well: 14 were reported last month, down from 73 in July.But in a country long on disappointment and short on hope, Dora represents only the embryo of progress. It was the first of several violent neighborhoods covered by a new Baghdad security plan  which seeks to create walled-in sanctuaries where economic development can grow in an environment of safety  and American and Iraqi officials are still struggling to make residents feel safe enough to let their children play in the streets.The local progress is coming as death tolls across the country have been soaring, up more than 50 percent in recent months, according to the latest Pentagon assessment. And in Baghdad as a whole, the toll has been high, with the citys morgue reporting more than 334 people killed or found dead from Aug. 24 to the end of the month.Most of those deaths occurred in areas without a reinforced military presence. Yet the challenge for American and Iraqi officials lies in spreading security to additional trouble spots without letting Dora slide back into lawlessness. American generals admit that lasting progress will be hard to achieve.The difficult part is going to be holding these areas with Iraqi security forces, the top United States commander, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., told reporters on Wednesday. And building the relationships between the Iraqi people in the neighborhood and their security forces so they can get on with their economic development.American forces have frequently focused on violent areas of Iraq and then moved on  in part because they lacked enough troops to hold the territory  only to return when chaos ensued. In Tal Afar for example, a dusty agrarian city northwest of Baghdad, American troops were forced to reassert control in 2005 after a large military offensive a year earlier failed to yield a lasting peace. In Dora, local leaders worry that violent gangs are just lying low, scouting for ways to circumvent the additional safeguards while attacking other neighborhoods or waiting for the Americans to leave. The calm situation right now is temporary, and if the state does not continue to build trust with the people, the situation might explode, said Sattar al-Jabouri, 51, a Sunni sheik and member of Doras municipal council. We know there are people who do not want this operation to succeed.Mr. Jabouri emphasized that the American presence had made Dora safer. Like others in the area, he raved about being able to sleep again on his roof, away from the sweltering indoor heat. He said some of the families who had fled the violence seemed to be returning, and that the Iraqis and Americans who searched his home were respectful and seemed sincerely interested in improving the neighborhood. Col. Michael Beech, the American commander overseeing Dora, said the second phase of the operation, now in effect, included cutting off all but a few access points, searching every car that entered Dora, and linking American soldiers with Iraqi police officers for joint patrols. Sections of the neighborhood have been assigned to the same squads so that residents and officers can become better acquainted. The United States military has also allotted $5 million to Dora and the surrounding area, with much of the current outlay going to Iraqis who pick up trash.On a recent afternoon, the results were hard to miss. Piles of rancid garbage behind the market had been cleared, and workers elsewhere tossed more into trucks. Iraqi police cars and American humvees lined the streets. Yet even as residents described the progress as encouraging, they said that life in Dora had not returned to normal. They trust neither neighbors nor the police. They still keep their children indoors. They still warn visitors to stay away. 12Next Page »Reporting for this article was contributed by Khalid W.
