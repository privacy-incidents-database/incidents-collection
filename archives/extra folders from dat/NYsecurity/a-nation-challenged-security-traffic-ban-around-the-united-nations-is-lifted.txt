A NATION CHALLENGED: SECURITY; Traffic Ban Around the United Nations Is Lifted
New York City scaled back its extensive security around the United Nations on Monday, lifting a ban on car and truck traffic that had been in place since Sept. 11 along part of First Avenue.
A similar scaling back of checkpoints is occurring at other locations, where, nearly four months after the terrorist attacks, security provisions have been re-evaluated in Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly's effort to raise the number of officers assigned to fighting crime.
United Nations officials welcomed the lifting of security measures, which used sanitation trucks filled with sand as barricades.
''The sanitation trucks stayed for nearly four months and now they have headed out,'' Farhan A. Haq, a United Nations spokesman, said yesterday. ''In fact, from my window the cars are passing right now.''
After Sept. 11, the sanitation trucks had taken up positions along 42nd Street and on First and Second Avenues. Combined with metal barricades, they did sentry duty at the United Nations, particularly during the recent General Assembly, a week of meetings among world leaders, when security was handled by the Secret Service.
Since then, security has reverted to United Nations security forces, the city's Police Department and other agencies, said Brian Marr, a Secret Service special agent.
Also on Monday, for the first time since Sept. 11, northbound traffic on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive was
allowed to exit at 42nd Street, near the United Nations, a police spokesman said.
Most foreign ministers have now returned home and it is not the busiest of times at the United Nations. But Mr. Haq added that officials were ''still monitoring the possibility of threats to this area.''
The reduced security reflects other changes. Officials also plan soon to reopen City Hall Park.
Security needs have also diminished at Gracie Mansion, because Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said he intends to continue living at his East Side town house. Security measures have been reduced at the Manhattan Bridge and at southbound thoroughfares along Canal Street.
Room for Debate asks whether shorefront homeowners should have to open their land to all comers.
New York Cityâ€™s top public schools must become more diverse.
