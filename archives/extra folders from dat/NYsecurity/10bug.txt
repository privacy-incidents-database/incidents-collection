An airport security line at Newark. The T.S.A. director says its new blog may help get the passenger and us on the same side.
“Ever since you started X-raying our shoes, I’ve been forced to carry all my plastic explosives in my pants, which I find most inconvenient.” Anonymous poster on the newT.S.A. blog, www.tsa.gov/blog/THERE’S at least one wiseacre in every bunch, which is something that Kip Hawley, the director of the Transportation Security Administration since 2005, says he factored into his decision to start a T.S.A. blog called Evolution of Security.Well, maybe more than one wiseacre and complainer. After all, the T.S.A. screens two million people a day, many of them chronically irritated by rules with which they don’t fully agree and by enforcement they sometimes consider arbitrary.This comes from the same blog: “... too many of your T.S.A. workers are just power-hungry morons.”Despite the bloggers’ complaints, the airport security experience has clearly become more predictable, if not more enjoyable, in recent years. Overall
wait times have improved, thanks in part to better training of the T.S.A.’s 43,000 security officers. Even after the imposition of much-disliked new rules —
like the ban on carrying liquids unless they are stored in individual three-ounce containers within quart-size plastic bags — lines generally move efficiently. Over the busy Thanksgiving holiday, for example, the average security wait time at airports was about 12 minutes, the T.S.A. said.
Still, it is not in the American DNA to enjoy taking orders from government employees. In December,
in a survey by The Associated Press of public attitudes toward 12 federal agencies, the T.S.A. and the Internal Revenue Service tied for second place as the two most disliked, behind only the Federal Emergency Management Agency.(The T.S.A. and I.R.S. are, of course, agencies where Americans and government sometimes
meet head-to-head in dispute. Widespread public conflict with the Defense Department or the Justice Department, for example, would probably have changed the rankings.)The T.S.A. blog has links to independent bloggers and real news reports, including negative ones. It also has personal blogs by five employees of the agency. But its most notable feature is the lively give-and-take, without refereeing,
except for monitoring for obscene language and egregious crack-pottery.The blog was intended to harness “the amount of energy that’s out there, and our need to get the passenger and us on the same side,” Mr. Hawley said.Most corporate or government blogs are just another form of news release
top-down, promotional, awe-struck by the wonders of the company and the manifest virtues of the boss.
The T.S.A. blog was deliberately designed to keep the brass at bay. And it isn’t shy about getting into a dust-up.“A whole lot of our employees are really anxious to engage with the public,” Mr. Hawley said. And, it turns out, vice versa. After the blog went up on Jan. 30, many reader responses were angry and sarcastic. But later, a greater sense of civil discussion set in.“We knew we were going to get a big surge of negativity; we knew it would be a very juicy opportunity” for
the angry, Mr. Hawley said, adding: “I think once people realize we’re putting substantive content on there and really answering questions, the tone will calm down
and it will lead to the same thing happening at the checkpoint.”Last week, readers scored a point after some complained about a security procedure. At some airports, screeners had been ordering passengers to remove all electronics from their bags, rather than just laptops. There is no such rule. “We learned that this exercise was set up by local T.S.A. officers,” the agency reported back on the blog. By Monday afternoon, the word had gone out to T.S.A. screeners nationally: BlackBerrys, iPods and other electronics stay in bags.
THERE is a security rationale for the blog, Mr. Hawley said. Confusion or
conflict at airport checkpoints can create a distraction, thus creating an opportunity for a terrorist.“What you want is a calm environment where you can do your job without being hurried or hassled, and where passengers are calm and understand the process,” Mr. Hawley said. “In order to really engage with the passengers and get them on our side, we have to be transparent and they have to have some trust.” On the blog, “we let you say what you want, and we get to push back at you. And we’ll see where it takes us.”
