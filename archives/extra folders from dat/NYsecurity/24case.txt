Computer Cases That Offer a Speedier Inspection on Your Dash to the Plane
With frustration mounting at airport security lines, something had to give. The Transportation Security Administration has decided to give frequent travelers a break. When laptops are placed in certain cases, like the ScanFast line from Mobile Edge, the agency does not require them to be removed from the case for screening.
While many laptop case manufacturers, including Targus and Skooba, are planning checkpoint-friendly cases, Mobile Edge will ship briefcases, backpacks and messenger bags next month. The bags separate the laptops from surrounding pockets, ensuring a clear picture on the X-ray machine.Most bags will still have to be opened, but the Mobile Edge bags flip back to offer an unobstructed view of the laptop inside.The bags will start at $80 and will be available online and in stores. They come in staid all-business black and will fit almost any laptop.
