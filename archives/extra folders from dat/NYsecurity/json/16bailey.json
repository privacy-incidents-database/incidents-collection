Driven by post-Sept. 11 wariness and the spread of public databases that enables more efficient checking from distant locations, the industry is now rapidly consolidating. A handful of national companies is bulking up by buying smaller competitors, seeking dominance in a business expected to double in sales over the next five years to $4 billion.",
