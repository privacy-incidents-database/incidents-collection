That is one reason New York officials put the city on high alert and publicized details of the threat, something the Federal Bureau of Investigation never intended to do. A senior law enforcement official said the threat against the New York landmarks was revealed last weekend during a debriefing of Mr. Zubaydah overseas. The information was deemed potentially credible because the military authorities had corroborated some, but not all, of the other statements he had made.",
