''Selling for health reasons.'' For years, the sign was meant as a joke by the store's owner, Richard Homan. But these days, the joke has a new punch line. These days, nobody would offer a hill of beans for Bobcat Sports. Business has dried up since Sept. 11, when New York City's Department of Environmental Protection closed all watershed land for security reasons. The measure was taken to prevent possible terrorist acts, including bioterrorism or damage to reservoir dams.",
