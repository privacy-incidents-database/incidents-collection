But the airport manager, Joel Russell, said that the vehicle, which belongs to the county police, ''sends a message about our police presence here.'' ''I like it,'' Mr. Russell said last week. ''It's symbolic and it has a practical use too.'' Creating a warm impression for passengers is not a priority right now, he said. In fact, the airport is set to install a bomb-proof ''curtain'' in the parking lot to protect the nearby passenger terminal from a possible car bomb.",
