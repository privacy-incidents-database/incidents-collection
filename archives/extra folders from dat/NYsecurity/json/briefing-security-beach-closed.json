The beach is closed from spring until fall because it is a nesting ground for the endangered piping plover, but it is usual opens after the nesting season ends. The Coast Guard base by the beach houses the Loran Support Unit, an electronic navigational facility that guides planes and boats. Karen DeMasters",
