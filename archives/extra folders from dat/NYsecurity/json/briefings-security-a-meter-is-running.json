Harvey said last week. New York City is receiving $50 million in federal funds to provide security during the convention. But New Jersey officials say that terrorism threats, and the costs they bring, do not end at the Hudson River. ''The sad truth is that New Jersey did not get a dime,'' Mr. Harvey said. He said he did not know how much overtime would be needed to conduct extra security sweeps and searches of bridges, tunnels and roads leading into New York, but he plans to keep a record of expenses to give to the federal government.",
