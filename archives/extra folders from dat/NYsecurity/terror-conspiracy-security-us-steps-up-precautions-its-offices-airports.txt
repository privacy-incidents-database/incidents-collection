THE TERROR CONSPIRACY: THE SECURITY; U.S. Steps Up Precautions At Its Offices And Airports
At government buildings in New York and at airports across the country, security was tightened yesterday within hours of the conviction of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and his followers in a bombing conspiracy trial.
Federico F. Pena, the United States Transportation Secretary, who ordered heightened security at the nation's airports in August, ordered still more security measures yesterday.
Officially, the measures were not attributed to the verdict. But a Federal official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they were responses to the verdict, last week's Israeli-Palestinian accord, the impending visit of Pope John Paul II and the impending 50th anniversary celebration of the United Nations, each of which has raised fears of terrorist attacks.
In a statement, Mr. Pena warned airline passengers that they should be more prepared than usual to identify themselves, to have their baggage inspected and answer questions about it, to observe parking restrictions and not leave cars unattended near terminals and to open the trunks of their cars on request.
"I ask the traveling public for your understanding and cooperation during periods of increased security," he said.
Since August, when law enforcement officials said they had received a bombing threat, security at Kennedy International Airport has been at the highest level at any American airport since the 1991 Persian Gulf war. Unattended cars have been towed, a parking lot has been closed and trash cans have been removed, along with any piece of luggage left by itself.
At government buildings in New York City yesterday, including courts and the building that houses offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, many more police officers and security guards were visible than on a normal Sunday. Officials at various agencies, including the Police Department, the F.B.I. and the Secret Service, would not acknowledge the added security, or say how long it would last.
A month ago, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey increased security at its buildings, which include the World Trade Center, the target of a February 1993 bombing tied to Mr. Abdel Rahman and his followers, and the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, which were said to be the among the group's intended targets.
"It has remained at an increased level since then," said Terry Benczik, a spokeswoman for the authority. She declined to specify the measures that had been taken.
