Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea Sign Maritime Security Agreement

Pirates target oil tankers, usually wanting hostages for ransom and to sell stolen fuel."The conclusion and signing of the agreement is expected to enhance security  in the Gulf of Guinea and help in curbing  maritime crimes such as piracy, crude oil theft, sabotage of oil rigs and arms smuggling," said Shehu.In a statement, Shehu said the agreement -- signed at the end of Buhari's two-day visit to Equatorial Guinea's capital, Malabo -- established "a combined Maritime Policing and Security Patrol Committee".
The creeks and waterways of the Niger Delta are connected to the Gulf of Guinea.Earlier this week Nigeria's information minister vowed that the government would prosecute those who attack the country's oil pipelines.Security experts say pirates have emerged from militant groups in Nigeria's oil-producing Niger Delta, such as the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND).(Reporting by Felix Onuah; Writing by Alexis Akwagyiram; Editing by Toby Chopra) Continue reading the main story
