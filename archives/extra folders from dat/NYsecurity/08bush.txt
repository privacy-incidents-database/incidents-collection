Bush Assures That the Nation Is Safer as Memories Turn to a Day of Destruction
President Bush telling supporters in Atlanta Thursday about the measures his administration has taken to prevent attacks like that of Sept. 11. He has been speaking often about domestic security as the anniversary nears.
ATLANTA, Sept. 7  Setting out his own narrative of what happened on Sept. 11, 2001, President Bush on Thursday defended his administrations record on domestic security, saying he had learned a lot of lessons on that day and had made Americans safer as a result. Speaking to an audience of conservative intellectuals here, Mr. Bush also called on Congress to pass legislation authorizing one of his most controversial antiterror initiatives, a once-secret National Security Agency program to eavesdrop on suspected members of Al Qaeda. The president used the latest in a series of his addresses leading up to the fifth anniversary of Sept. 11 to continue his effort to reshape the political climate by focusing the nation on the threat from terrorism rather than the war in Iraq. He mentioned only briefly the proposal he unveiled on Wednesday for interrogating and trying
detainees linked to terrorism.Instead, he offered his version of how terrorists plotted to attack the United States on Sept. 11 and used that framework to present a progress report  a rebuttal to critics who say he has not done enough and a playbook that Republican candidates may use as they face skeptical voters in November.There is a wide range of narratives competing to define how the Sept. 11 attacks
came about and played out, from the liberal version embodied in Michael Moores Fahrenheit 911 to the partly fictionalized account in a coming ABC miniseries The Path to 9/11, which has drawn intense criticism from former Clinton administration officials who say it misrepresents what they did to confront Al Qaeda.
In Mr. Bushs version of events, there was no mention of the August 2001 intelligence report warning that Osama bin Laden was plotting to attack inside the United States. Nor was there any of his own early response, judged by his critics to have been erratic, after learning, during a visit to a Florida elementary school, that planes had crashed into the Word Trade Center.Instead, the president laid out what he said were the four critical phases of the plot: its early planning abroad; the movement of the first Qaeda operatives to the United States; the arrival of the remainder of the plotters and the flight training they undertook; and the morning of the attacks, when the terrorists passed airport security to board the ill-fated flights. Many Americans look at these events, Mr. Bush said, and ask the same question: Five years after 9/11, are we safer? The answer is, yes, America is safer. We are safer because weve taken action to protect the homeland.For each phase, the president ticked off a litany of steps his administration had taken, like air security improvements and
revamping intelligence agencies so they can share information more freely. To buttress his case, the White House released a 21-page report entitled 9/11 Five Years Later: Successes and Challenges, stuffed with facts and numbers.I learned a lot of lessons on 9/11, Mr. Bush said at one point. At another, he said, Weve learned the lessons of 9/11, and we have addressed the gaps in our defenses exposed by that attack.Critics, including Democrats and the Republican co-chairman of the commission that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks, say the Bush administration has not done nearly enough to prevent another attack. The co-chairman, Thomas H. Kean, a former New Jersey governor, said in an interview last week that both the
administration and Congress should be held accountable for failing to adopt his panels recommendations in their entirety.The most dangerous gap is the possibility of a terrorist with a nuclear weapon, Mr. Kean said, when asked to cite an example of a vulnerability. We still havent done enough to contain about a hundred sites around the world that have enriched uranium.During a year when control of Congress may turn on the question of which party is better suited to keep Americans safe, Mr. Bush is clearly trying to take the offensive. A senior White House official, who requested anonymity before talking about internal strategy, said that Thursdays address was a way to hammer home the safer yet not safe theme.It was a way for the president to go back and say, They got into the country, heres what would happen today, the official said. They got money, heres what would happen today, and kind of go through those four phases to spell out how we are safer but still not safe.Later in the day, Mr. Bush turned more directly to politics, traveling to Savannah to attend a fund-raiser for Max Burns, a former Republican congressman who is trying to regain his seat. Mr. Bushs request for Congress to authorize the federal eavesdropping
his second legislative request in as many days. On Wednesday he called on lawmakers to approve a bill creating new military commissions to try terror suspects, replacing
tribunals that the administration had authorized but that were struck down by the Supreme Court.The surest way to keep the program, Mr. Bush said, referring to the eavesdropping, is to get explicit approval from the United States Congress.
