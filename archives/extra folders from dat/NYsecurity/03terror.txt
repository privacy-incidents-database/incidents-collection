Airline Screening Plan Wins Tentative Praise - The New York Times

WASHINGTON — Aviation security experts and industry officials said Friday that new screening protocols for air passengers coming to the United States were a marked improvement over an emergency plan that has required extra screening of every passenger from 14 countries since the attempted bombing of an airliner on Christmas Day.They said that the new system promised to bring more complete and timely threat information to bear on decisions about who should be prevented from boarding an airliner.But they also said that the impact of the changes on both the safety and convenience of air travel would not be evident for months.Administration officials who described the basics of the new protocols on Friday said they would allow fragmentary but specific intelligence on terrorist threats — like the characteristics of new recruits for Al Qaeda — to be matched against the list of passengers who were not on any watch list.Passengers whose personal data, travel histories and other details raise concerns would then be subjected to “secondary screening,” which can involve questioning, pat-downs and body scans.
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian man charged with trying to blow up the Christmas flight, was not given extra screening before boarding his flight in Amsterdam despite considerable evidence that he might pose a security risk.“These new measures utilize real-time, threat-based intelligence along with multiple, random layers of security, both seen and unseen, to more effectively mitigate evolving terrorist threats,” said Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security.Since January, Ms. Napolitano has participated in three aviation security summits, in Spain, Mexico and Japan, to consult with foreign counterparts about how to protect flights from terrorists. She said many other countries had stepped up security measures and intelligence-sharing since the near-disaster over Detroit.
Passengers waited to be screened and to pass through metal detectors in the main terminal of the airport in Frankfurt, Germany, in January.
The new scrutiny will be applied to every passenger on flights from overseas bound for the United States, officials said. They said the number of people identified for secondary screening was likely to decline compared with the post-Christmas focus on everyone from the 14 “countries of concern,” but would probably be higher than the pre-Christmas average.The number of passengers chosen at random for extra screening will also increase, officials said.The Transportation Security Administration said people flying to the United States “may want to allow additional time to get through security” and
advised checking with airlines and airports abroad.Before
Dec. 25, airlines were given the no-fly list of people to be barred from flights altogether and a second “selectee” list of passengers to be subjected to more thorough screening. Those lists have been expanded considerably this year and now contain about 6,000 and 20,000 names respectively, officials said.The new system will send the airlines additional names of passengers not on either the no-fly or selectee list but identified as possible security risks because of intelligence about threats. Only the names of the passengers selected for extra screening, not the underlying intelligence, will be shared with airlines and foreign security personnel, officials said.Stewart Baker, who served as assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, said the new measures were a distinct improvement on the emergency policies imposed after the Christmas bombing.
“I do think it makes sense to look at people and not nationalities,” Mr. Baker said. He said he also thought the new plan promised to do a better job of applying fresh intelligence to preflight screening.“It’s an experiment, and we’ll have to see how it works,” said Mr. Baker, a Washington lawyer whose book on counterterrorism, “Skating on Stilts,” is scheduled for publication in June.Airline industry trade groups
criticized the country-based approach earlier this year, saying it failed to make efficient use of the extensive data that immigration and customs authorities in many countries already collect about air travelers.
“This is a welcome and very important first step toward creating a more intelligent security system where we start looking for bad people, wherever they may live, rather than issuing blanket indictments of entire countries,” Steven Lott, a spokesman in Washington for the Geneva-based International Air Transport Association, said of the revised protocols.Civil liberties advocates had a cautiously positive reaction. Farhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates, which had protested the blanket screening of citizens of mostly Muslim countries, said the new plan sounded better. She noted that the post-Christmas screening would not have singled out Richard Reid, the so-called shoe bomber of December 2001, who was a British citizen.“We are very pleased that the administration heard our message that effective policies should focus on suspicious behavior and legitimate leads, not national origin, ethnicity or religion,” she said.But in Europe, where privacy concerns have sometimes clashed with American counterintelligence efforts, the reaction was wary.“Passenger name records are behavioral data,” said Sophie in ’t Veld, a Dutch member of the European Parliament and advocate of civil liberties. “One of our main concerns has always been that this data not be used for data mining and profiling. Using behavioral data to look for patterns and making law enforcement decisions on that basis — if that is not profiling, then what is?”
Some members of Congress praised the new program but complained that they were not briefed on it in advance.“While this new policy is a step in the right direction, I hope to work with the White House on a more coordinated rollout in the future,” said Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.The committee’s top Republican, Representative Peter T. King of New York, likewise called the new measures “a significant step forward,” but he criticized the White House for what he said was a pattern of failing to share information with Congress.A transportation security
official said Mr. King had been given advance notice of the changes and offered a classified briefing.
A picture caption on Saturday with an article about the response of aviation security experts and industry officials to new screening protocols for air passengers traveling to the United States referred incorrectly to the passengers shown inside the main terminal of the airport in Frankfurt, Germany. They were waiting to have their carry-on luggage screened and to pass through metal detectors. They were not waiting to check in their luggage.
