Bad Enough Being Shoeless but Just Look at This Décor
AT the airport security checkpoints, I always look at the hodgepodge of folding tables and figure that somewhere,
is missing its furniture.That was going through my mind the other day while leaving the Tucson airport. I’d been away from home for more than
a week working, so my carry-on and laptop were stuffed with files.Passengers and screeners alike all looked as if
they were silently humming “Sixteen Tons.” Hoist those bags! Keep those bins moving!In front of me was a uniformed pilot guiding himself and two small girls, both with their pink rollaboards, through the checkpoint. I’m always amazed at how parents can maneuver bag-laden children
in those circumstances without losing at least a backpack, let alone a child.One screener was evidently
in charge of ensuring that passengers knew they had to remove those
portable CPAP devices (for continuous positive airway pressure) that have become popular travel accessories
sleep apnea, a common ailment in which airways tighten, interrupting sleep.
“Take all CPAPs out of your carry-on bags,” the screener kept saying.Behind me a woman put her backpack on the roller belt. Wearing latex gloves, the screener pressed on a small bulge in the backpack.“Is that a CPAP, ma’am? It looks like a CPAP,” the screener said.“It also looks like a chicken sandwich, which is what it is,” the woman replied wearily.In front of me, the pilot’s children were now safely on the other side of the magnetometer. He heaved his own stuff onto the belt and removed his shoes.“I thought you guys didn’t have to take your shoes off if you were in uniform,” I said.He gave me a look and said, “Do not get me started.”On the other side of the magnetometer, there was the usual pile-up that always reminds me of that classic “I Love Lucy”
flips into warp speed. Bags, bins and laptops piled up while kids and adults hopped on one foot to put on their shoes as screeners scrambled to haul empty bins away.We spend about
$5 billion a year in federal money on airport security. Yes, screeners do good work under tough conditions, and, yes, the Transportation Security Administration is working on better technology for better security.But why do the checkpoints still look like garage sales?“Don’t get me started,” said Ira Weinstein, the president of AIR Inc., a market research and consulting company that works with airports. Evidently it’s the new catch phrase.“There are no standards of furniture or fixtures from airport to airport. It seems to all be under the auspices of the T.S.A. and/or the airport and/or nobody knows,” Mr. Weinstein said, adding: “The furniture is usually folding bridge chairs
$59 to $69 a table at Kmart. At some airports, they bought stainless-steel autopsy tables, but they don’t match up either, and you still have people getting fingers bruised or cut as bags pile up or fall off.”
There have been scattered improvements, he said. The Atlanta airport bought tables actually designed to match the X-ray machines. A few airports have sold advertising space on newly designed bins, and some have bought systems to move bins back to the front of the queue so that “screeners who ought to be doing security aren’t working as bin collectors,” he said.Given bare or stockinged feet, the lack of floor mats is also a chronic problem,
Mr. Weinstein said. Matt Blaze, an associate professor of computer science
at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert in security cryptology, agreed.“Somehow we ended up with this cobbled-together mess,” he said. “At the very point in the process at which you have to take your shoes off, that’s where the carpeting ends.”From a customer service standpoint, it’s “infuriating,” he said. But
raises genuine security concerns.“There’s no better place to get away with something than a chaotic environment,” he said.
