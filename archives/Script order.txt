Order of Scripts to Run

Scenario 1: Use only NYtimes Articles

1. Run collect.py to fetch negative(Non-privacy) Articles as follows:

   python collect.py -l LIMIT NYnegative
   Where LIMIT is the maximum number of Articles you wish to fetch

2. Run collect_positive.py to fetch positive(Privacy) Articles as follows:

   python collect_positive.py -j JSON
   Where JSON is the name of the json file containing URL's for positive articles

3. Run gen_csv.py for generating a CSV as follows:

   python gen_csv.py
   This script will generate a CSV named data.csv which can be further used for analysis.

Scenario 2: Use all the articles in the DB and use NLP for analysis

1. Run collect.py to fetch negative(Non-privacy) Articles as follows:

   python collect.py -l LIMIT NYnegative
   Where LIMIT is the maximum number of Articles you wish to fetch

   OR

   Store all the negative articles(text) in a directory.

2. Run collect_positive.py to fetch positive(Privacy) Articles as follows:

   python collect_positive.py -j JSON
   Where JSON is the name of the json file containing URL's for positive articles

3. Remove the non-ascii characters by running remove_non_ascii.py

4. Perform NLP on the collected articles using nltk_nlp.py or spacy_nlp.py as follows:

   python nltk_nlp.py DIRECTORY
   Where DIRECTORY is the name of the directory which contains text articles

5. Generate an IDF log using tfid_log.py as follows:

   python tfid_log.py LIBRARY
   Where LIBRARY is either nltk or spacy

6. Generate CSV using tfidf_csv.py as follows:

   python tfidf_csv.py LIBRARY
   This script will generate a CSV named tfidf-LIBRARY.csv which can be further used for analysis.
   Where LIBRARY is either nltk or spacy
