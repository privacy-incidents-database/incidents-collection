'a very tasty air'

                    thomas jefferson would be delighted with the reincarnation of his favorite hideaway in  the foothills of virginia's blue ridge mountains. it was to poplar forest in bedford county, near lynchburg, that he used to flee to find the ''solitude of a hermit,'' when life became too hectic at monticello.        

                    poplar forest was the private haven where jefferson could retire with his books and writings and grandchildren. there is no evidence that sally hemings, the slave woman who is alleged to have conceived at least one of his children at monticello, accompanied her master on these retreats. but sally's brother john hemings was chief carpenter for the estate and brought over two of her sons, eston and beverly, as assistants.        

                    in the last century and a half, poplar forest suffered many alterations, and by the early 1980's was threatened with extinction. alarmed, a small group of civic-minded virginia citizens took up the mission to save this national landmark and soon received broad grass-roots support.        

                    now, poplar forest has been transformed into a fascinating museum-in-progress, where visitors are welcome to follow each step of the rescue effort. jefferson's small  octagonal masterpiece has regained its original profile and work is under way to restore the interior and landscape. in october, the national trust for historic preservation recognized the poplar forest restoration with its 1998 national preservation honor award.        

                    the view of poplar forest today is much as it was in the early 19th century, with encroaching development barely visible. beyond the formal carriage circle rises the elegant red-brick mansion with white portico and grass-green shutters, flanked by a few ancient tulip poplars, two earth mounds and kiosklike brick necessaries (privies). jefferson's beloved octagonal walls have been reinforced with an invisible concrete footing.        

                    the columned porticoes facing north and south have been restored and the classical roof completely rebuilt. the central rotunda has recovered its 20-foot ceiling, skylight and original grandeur.        

                    poplar forest, along with the university of virginia, is a creation of jefferson's  later life, and the culmination of his studies in architecture and landscaping. this was his ideal country villa, with only six rooms (and separate kitchen facilities), where he could indulge his fantasies in design, inspired by palladio, the influential 16th-century italian architect who aimed to recapture the splendor of antiquity.        

                    although monticello was undisputably his first love, jefferson wrote proudly of poplar forest in 1812: ''when finished, it will be the best dwelling house in the state, except that of monticello; perhaps preferable to that, as more proportioned to the faculties of a private citizen.''        

                    the 4,812-acre tobacco and wheat farm at poplar forest was part of a legacy of 11,000 acres and 135 slaves left to jefferson's wife, martha, in 1773 by her father, john wayles. in 1781, during the revolutionary war, jefferson and his family sought refuge at poplar forest, where they briefly lived in an overseer's house and jefferson wrote much of his book ''notes on the state of virginia.''        

                    not until 1806 at age 63, did jefferson begin work on the poplar forest mansion, personally helping to lay the foundations and closely supervising the landscaping. the rural retreat was largely completed by the time his term as president was up three years later.        

                    subsequently, he made the 93-mile, two-and-a-half-day journey by horse from monticello about three times a year for stays ranging from two weeks to two months.        

                    jefferson's granddaughter ellen randolph coolidge, who generally accompanied him on these visits, recalled in 1856: ''at poplar forest he found in a pleasant home, rest, leisure, power to carry on his favorite pursuits -- to think, study, to read, whilst the presence of part of his family took away all character of solitude from his retreat.''        

                    in 1823, jefferson turned over poplar forest to his grandson francis eppes. he sold the property, which was plagued by problems like a leaking roof, to a neighbor two years after jefferson's death in 1826, and it was resold several times. major changes occurred after a devastating fire in 1845, when the house was remodeled in fashionable greek revival style, and in the 1940's, when it was updated with five modern bathrooms, a kitchen and cabinets.        

                    recent owners gradually sold off the land to developers, and by 1980 this national monument had come close to fatal dismemberment, with only 50 acres of the original plantation left. alarmed, four local citizens, from lynchburg and bedford, decided that something had to be done, and set up the nonprofit corporation for jefferson's poplar forest in 1984.        

                    saving the house and property has gone from a community effort to a national cause. initially, bedford county school children collected jefferson nickels for the project and university of virginia alumni helped clear the land. now the committee for friends of poplar forest receives support from branch committees around the country. in the last 15 years, some $17 million has been raised -- mostly from private sources.
